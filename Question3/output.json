The current behavior of the Earth-Moon system agrees\nwith this model very well and the general pattern of the evolution of the\nMoon-Earth system described by this model agrees with geological and fossil\nevidence. The closest distance of the Moon to Earth was about 259000 km at 4.5\nbillion years ago, which is far beyond the Roche's limit. The result suggests\nthat the tidal friction may not be the primary cause for the evolution of the\nEarth-Moon system. The average dark matter field fluid constant derived from\nEarth-Moon system data is 4.39 x 10^(-22) s^(-1)m^(-1). This model predicts\nthat the Mars's rotation is also slowing with the angular acceleration rate\nabout -4.38 x 10^(-22) rad s^(-2).\n",

Moreover, the linear term is\nsignificantly smaller for cubically than for non-cubically shaped scatterers.\nTherefore, for small d errors for cubically shaped particles are much smaller\nthan for non-cubically shaped. The relative importance of the linear term\ndecreases with increasing size, hence convergence of DDA for large enough\nscatterers is quadratic in the common range of d.

The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be converted\ninto heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETIC\nCASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space and\nvelocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each of\nthe physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematically\nreduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the \"inertial range\" above the\nion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenic\nfluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisional\nand collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,\nwhich obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associated\nwith the Alfvenic component. In the \"dissipation range\" between the ion and\nelectron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave\n(KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passive\nphase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings the\nenergy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionless\nwave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in the\nphase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at the\nelectron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scaling\nrelations are derived for these cascades. Astrophysical and space-physical\napplications are discussed in detail.\n",

We consider\nlarge-scale hydrodynamic motions where the viscosity and heat conduction can be\nneglected, and one arrives at the equations of ideal gas dynamics with an\nadditional term describing bulk energy losses due to inelastic collisions. We\nemploy Lagrangian coordinates and derive a broad family of exact non-stationary\nanalytical solutions that depend only on one spatial coordinate. These\nsolutions exhibit a new type of singularity, where the gas density blows up in\na finite time when starting from smooth initial conditions. The density blowups\nsignal formation of close-packed clusters of particles. As the density blow-up\ntime $t_c$ is approached, the maximum density exhibits a power law $\\sim\n(t_c-t)^{-2}$. The velocity gradient blows up as $\\sim - (t_c-t)^{-1}$ while\nthe velocity itself remains continuous and develops a cusp (rather than a shock\ndiscontinuity) at the singularity. The gas temperature vanishes at the\nsingularity, and the singularity follows the isobaric scenario: the gas\npressure remains finite and approximately uniform in space and constant in time\nclose to the singularity. An additional exact solution shows that the density\nblowup, of the same type, may coexist with an \"ordinary\" shock, at which the\nhydrodynamic fields are discontinuous but finite. We confirm stability of the\nexact solutions with respect to small one-dimensional perturbations by solving\nthe ideal hydrodynamic equations numerically. Furthermore, numerical solutions\nshow that the local features of the density blowup hold universally,\nindependently of details of the initial and boundary conditions.\n",

The approximation makes feasible an efficient estimation of\nthe redundancy of data along with the related experimental information and\ninformation cost function. From the experimental information the complexity of\nthe phenomenon can be simply estimated, while the proper number of experiments\nneeded for its exploration can be determined from the minimum of the cost\nfunction. The performance of the approximate estimation of these statistics is\ndemonstrated on two-dimensional normally distributed random data.\n",

    "abstract": "  Given a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel, feedback from the\nreceiver can be used to specify a transmit precoding matrix, which selectively\nactivates the strongest channel modes. Here we analyze the performance of\nRandom Vector Quantization (RVQ), in which the precoding matrix is selected\nfrom a random codebook containing independent, isotropically distributed\nentries. We assume that channel elements are i.i.d. and known to the receiver,\nwhich relays the optimal (rate-maximizing) precoder codebook index to the\ntransmitter using B bits. We first derive the large system capacity of\nbeamforming (rank-one precoding matrix) as a function of B, where large system\nrefers to the limit as B and the number of transmit and receive antennas all go\nto infinity with fixed ratios. With beamforming RVQ is asymptotically optimal,\ni.e., no other quantization scheme can achieve a larger asymptotic rate. The\nperformance of RVQ is also compared with that of a simpler reduced-rank scalar\nquantization scheme in which the beamformer is constrained to lie in a random\nsubspace. We subsequently consider a precoding matrix with arbitrary rank, and\napproximate the asymptotic RVQ performance with optimal and linear receivers\n(matched filter and Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE)). Numerical examples show\nthat these approximations accurately predict the performance of finite-size\nsystems of interest. Given a target spectral efficiency, numerical examples\nshow that the amount of feedback required by the linear MMSE receiver is only\nslightly more than that required by the optimal receiver, whereas the matched\nfilter can require significantly more feedback.\n",

    "abstract": "  This article belongs to a series on geometric complexity theory (GCT), an\napproach to the P vs. NP and related problems through algebraic geometry and\nrepresentation theory. The basic principle behind this approach is called the\nflip. In essence, it reduces the negative hypothesis in complexity theory (the\nlower bound problems), such as the P vs. NP problem in characteristic zero, to\nthe positive hypothesis in complexity theory (the upper bound problems):\nspecifically, to showing that the problems of deciding nonvanishing of the\nfundamental structural constants in representation theory and algebraic\ngeometry, such as the well known plethysm constants--or rather certain relaxed\nforms of these decision probelms--belong to the complexity class P. In this\narticle, we suggest a plan for implementing the flip, i.e., for showing that\nthese relaxed decision problems belong to P. This is based on the reduction of\nthe preceding complexity-theoretic positive hypotheses to mathematical\npositivity hypotheses: specifically, to showing that there exist positive\nformulae--i.e. formulae with nonnegative coefficients--for the structural\nconstants under consideration and certain functions associated with them. These\nturn out be intimately related to the similar positivity properties of the\nKazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and the multiplicative structural constants of the\ncanonical (global crystal) bases in the theory of Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum\ngroups. The known proofs of these positivity properties depend on the Riemann\nhypothesis over finite fields and the related results. Thus the reduction here,\nin conjunction with the flip, in essence, says that the validity of the P vs.\nNP conjecture in characteristic zero is intimately linked to the Riemann\nhypothesis over finite fields and related problems.\n",

    "abstract": "  Structure entails function and thus a structural description of the brain\nwill help to understand its function and may provide insights into many\nproperties of brain systems, from their robustness and recovery from damage, to\ntheir dynamics and even their evolution. Advances in the analysis of complex\nnetworks provide useful new approaches to understanding structural and\nfunctional properties of brain networks. Structural properties of networks\nrecently described allow their characterization as small-world, random\n(exponential) and scale-free. They complement the set of other properties that\nhave been explored in the context of brain connectivity, such as topology,\nhodology, clustering, and hierarchical organization. Here we apply new network\nanalysis methods to cortical inter-areal connectivity networks for the cat and\nmacaque brains. We compare these corticocortical fibre networks to benchmark\nrewired, small-world, scale-free and random networks, using two analysis\nstrategies, in which we measure the effects of the removal of nodes and\nconnections on the structural properties of the cortical networks. The brain\nnetworks' structural decay is in most respects similar to that of scale-free\nnetworks. The results implicate highly connected hub-nodes and bottleneck\nconnections as structural basis for some of the conditional robustness of brain\nsystems. This informs the understanding of the development of brain networks'\nconnectivity.\n",

    "abstract": "  This paper investigates the many-to-one throughput capacity (and by symmetry,\none-to-many throughput capacity) of IEEE 802.11 multi-hop networks. It has\ngenerally been assumed in prior studies that the many-to-one throughput\ncapacity is upper-bounded by the link capacity L. Throughput capacity L is not\nachievable under 802.11. This paper introduces the notion of \"canonical\nnetworks\", which is a class of regularly-structured networks whose capacities\ncan be analyzed more easily than unstructured networks. We show that the\nthroughput capacity of canonical networks under 802.11 has an analytical upper\nbound of 3L/4 when the source nodes are two or more hops away from the sink;\nand simulated throughputs of 0.690L (0.740L) when the source nodes are many\nhops away. We conjecture that 3L/4 is also the upper bound for general\nnetworks. When all links have equal length, 2L/3 can be shown to be the upper\nbound for general networks. Our simulations show that 802.11 networks with\nrandom topologies operated with AODV routing can only achieve throughputs far\nbelow the upper bounds. Fortunately, by properly selecting routes near the\ngateway (or by properly positioning the relay nodes leading to the gateway) to\nfashion after the structure of canonical networks, the throughput can be\nimproved significantly by more than 150%. Indeed, in a dense network, it is\nworthwhile to deactivate some of the relay nodes near the sink judiciously.\n",

Spectral analysis of C for NSE reveals that,\nthe few largest eigenvalues deviate from the bulk of the spectrum predicted by\nrandom matrix theory, but they are far fewer in number compared to, e.g., NYSE.\nWe show this to be due to the relative weakness of intra-sector interactions\nbetween stocks, compared to the market mode, by modeling stock price dynamics\nwith a two-factor model.

    "abstract": "  We present a hierarchical simulation approach for the dependability analysis\nand evaluation of a highly available commercial cache-based RAID storage\nsystem. The archi-tecture is complex and includes several layers of\noverlap-ping error detection and recovery mechanisms. Three ab-straction levels\nhave been developed to model the cache architecture, cache operations, and\nerror detection and recovery mechanism. The impact of faults and errors\noc-curring in the cache and in the disks is analyzed at each level of the\nhierarchy. A simulation submodel is associated with each abstraction level. The\nmodels have been devel-oped using DEPEND, a simulation-based environment for\nsystem-level dependability analysis, which provides facili-ties to inject\nfaults into a functional behavior model, to simulate error detection and\nrecovery mechanisms, and to evaluate quantitative measures. Several fault\nmodels are defined for each submodel to simulate cache component failures, disk\nfailures, transmission errors, and data errors in the cache memory and in the\ndisks. Some of the parame-ters characterizing fault injection in a given\nsubmodel cor-respond to probabilities evaluated from the simulation of the\nlower-level submodel. Based on the proposed method-ology, we evaluate and\nanalyze 1) the system behavior un-der a real workload and high error rate\n(focusing on error bursts), 2) the coverage of the error detection mechanisms\nimplemented in the system and the error latency distribu-tions, and 3) the\naccumulation of errors in the cache and in the disks.\n",

We find a size-dependent cumulative\nadvantage for the impact of universities in terms of total number of citations.\nIn previous work a similar scaling rule was found at the level of research\ngroups. Therefore we conjecture that this scaling rule is a prevalent property\nof the science system. We observe that lower performance universities have a\nlarger size-dependent cumulative advantage for receiving citations than\ntop-performance universities. We also find that for the lower-performance\nuniversities the fraction of not-cited publications decreases considerably with\nsize. Generally, the higher the average journal impact of the publications of a\nuniversity, the lower the number of not-cited publications. We find that the\naverage research performance does not dilute with size. Large top-performance\nuniversities succeed in keeping a high performance over a broad range of\nactivities.

Next we find that particularly for the lower-performance universities\nthe field citation density provides a strong cumulative advantage in citations\nper publication. The relation between number of citations and field citation\ndensity found in this study can be considered as a second basic scaling rule of\nthe science system. Top-performance universities publish in journals with\nsignificantly higher journal impact as compared to the lower performance\nuniversities.

Using the AutoCorrelation Function\nand Mutual Information we establish the presence of nonlinear effects in the\nmechanism of increasing mass of atomic nuclei considered as a function of the\natomic number. We find that increasing mass is divergent, possibly chaotic. We\nalso investigate the possible existence of a Power Law for atomic nuclei and,\nusing also the technique of the variogram, we conclude that a fractal regime\ncould superintend to the mechanism of increasing mass for nuclei. Finally,\nusing the Hurst exponent, evidence is obtained that the mechanism of increasing\nmass in atomic nuclei is in the fractional Brownian regime. The most\ninteresting results are obtained by using Recurrence Quantification Analysis\n(RQA). New recurrences, psudoperiodicities, self-resemblance and class of\nself-similarities are identified with values of determinism showing oscillating\nvalues indicating the presence of more or less stability during the process of\nincreasing mass of atomic nuclei. In brief, new regimes of regularities are\nidentified for atomic nuclei that deserve to be studied by future researches.\nIn particular an accurate analysis of binding energy values by nonlinear\nmethods is further required.\n",

The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is usually a main factor in\ndetermining the probability of error (or of communication failure) in a link.\nThese probabilities are then a proxy for the SNR under which the links operate.\nThe paper studies the problem of designing the topology, i.e., assigning the\nprobabilities of reliable communication among sensors (or of link failures) to\nmaximize the rate of convergence of average consensus, when the link\ncommunication costs are taken into account, and there is an overall\ncommunication budget constraint. To consider this problem, we address a number\nof preliminary issues: (1) model the network as a random topology; (2)\nestablish necessary and sufficient conditions for mean square sense (mss) and\nalmost sure (a.s.) convergence of average consensus when network links fail;\nand, in particular, (3) show that a necessary and sufficient condition for both\nmss and a.s. convergence is for the algebraic connectivity of the mean graph\ndescribing the network topology to be strictly positive. With these results, we\nformulate topology design, subject to random link failures and to a\ncommunication cost constraint, as a constrained convex optimization problem to\nwhich we apply semidefinite programming techniques. We show by an extensive\nnumerical study that the optimal design improves significantly the convergence\nspeed of the consensus algorithm and can achieve the asymptotic performance of\na non-random network at a fraction of the communication cost.\n",

In a MIMO-based mesh network, the links outgoing from each\nnode sharing the common communication spectrum can be modeled as a Gaussian\nvector broadcast channel. Recently, researchers showed that ``dirty paper\ncoding'' (DPC) is the optimal transmission strategy for Gaussian vector\nbroadcast channels. So far, there has been little study on how this fundamental\nresult will impact the cross-layer design for MIMO-based mesh networks. To fill\nthis gap, we consider the problem of jointly optimizing DPC power allocation in\nthe link layer at each node and multihop/multipath routing in a MIMO-based mesh\nnetworks. It turns out that this optimization problem is a very challenging\nnon-convex problem.

For the\ntransformed problem, we develop an efficient solution procedure that integrates\nLagrangian dual decomposition method, conjugate gradient projection method\nbased on matrix differential calculus, cutting-plane method, and subgradient\nmethod.

In a setting generalizing the multi-armed\nbandit problem, after choosing a path, the decision maker learns only the\nweights of those edges that belong to the chosen path. For this problem, an\nalgorithm is given whose average cumulative loss in n rounds exceeds that of\nthe best path, matched off-line to the entire sequence of the edge weights, by\na quantity that is proportional to 1/\\sqrt{n} and depends only polynomially on\nthe number of edges of the graph. The algorithm can be implemented with linear\ncomplexity in the number of rounds n and in the number of edges. An extension\nto the so-called label efficient setting is also given, in which the decision\nmaker is informed about the weights of the edges corresponding to the chosen\npath at a total of m << n time instances. Another extension is shown where the\ndecision maker competes against a time-varying path, a generalization of the\nproblem of tracking the best expert. A version of the multi-armed bandit\nsetting for shortest path is also discussed where the decision maker learns\nonly the total weight of the chosen path but not the weights of the individual\nedges on the path.

If\nthe emitter moves away from us, a redshift is observed. If the emitter moves\ntowards us, whether a redshift, a blueshift or no shift is observed will depend\non the speed vs. the distance. If the speed is in the range of\nc(exp[-beta*D]-1) < v < 0, a redshift is observed; if the speed equals\nc(exp[-beta*D]-1), no shift is observed; if the speed v less than\nc(exp[-beta*D]-1), a blueshift is observed. A redshift will be always observed\nin all directions for any celestial objects as long as their distance from us\nis large enough. Therefore, many more redshifts than blueshifts should be\nobserved for galaxies and supernovae, etc in the sky. This conclusion agrees\nwith current observations. The estimated value of the redshift constant beta of\nthe dark matter field fluid is in the range of 10^(-3) ~ 10^(-5)/Mpc.

The polymer ensemble is described on the mesoscopic level by a\nset of stochastic ordinary differential equations with Brownian noise. The\ndynamics of the Newtonian solvent is determined by the Navier-Stokes equations.\nMomentum transfer of the dumbbells with the solvent is implemented by an\nadditional volume forcing term in the Navier-Stokes equations, such that both\ncomponents of the resulting viscoelastic fluid are connected by a two-way\ncoupling. The dynamics of the dumbbells is given then by Newton's second law of\nmotion including small inertia effects. We investigate the dynamics of the flow\nfor different degrees of dumbbell elasticity and inertia, as given by\nWeissenberg and Stokes numbers, respectively. For the parameters accessible in\nour study, the magnitude of the feedback of the polymers on the macroscopic\nproperties of turbulence remains small as quantified by the global energy\nbudget and the Reynolds stresses. A reduction of the turbulent drag by up to\n20% is observed for the larger particle inertia. The angular statistics of the\ndumbbells shows an increasing alignment with the mean flow direction for both,\nincreasing elasticity and inertia. This goes in line with a growing asymmetry\nof the probability density function of the transverse derivative of the\nstreamwise turbulent velocity component. We find that dumbbells get stretched\nreferentially in regions where vortex stretching or bi-axial strain dominate\nthe local dynamics and topology of the velocity gradient tensor.\n",

Using the cavity method, we present a detailed and systematic analytical\nstudy of the space of proper colorings (solutions).\n  We show that for a fixed number of colors and as the average vertex degree\n(number of constraints) increases, the set of solutions undergoes several phase\ntransitions similar to those observed in the mean field theory of glasses.\nFirst, at the clustering transition, the entropically dominant part of the\nphase space decomposes into an exponential number of pure states so that beyond\nthis transition a uniform sampling of solutions becomes hard. Afterward, the\nspace of solutions condenses over a finite number of the largest states and\nconsequently the total entropy of solutions becomes smaller than the annealed\none. Another transition takes place when in all the entropically dominant\nstates a finite fraction of nodes freezes so that each of these nodes is\nallowed a single color in all the solutions inside the state. Eventually, above\nthe coloring threshold, no more solutions are available. We compute all the\ncritical connectivities for Erdos-Renyi and regular random graphs and determine\ntheir asymptotic values for large number of colors.\n  Finally, we discuss the algorithmic consequences of our findings. We argue\nthat the onset of computational hardness is not associated with the clustering\ntransition and we suggest instead that the freezing transition might be the\nrelevant phenomenon. We also discuss the performance of a simple local Walk-COL\nalgorithm and of the belief propagation algorithm in the light of our results.\n",

This identity potentially provides a new application\ndomain for all broadly applicable PL techniques: MCO. Second, we introduce\nimmediate sampling, a new version of the Probability Collectives (PC) algorithm\nfor blackbox optimization. Immediate sampling transforms the original BO\nproblem into an MCO problem. Accordingly, by combining these first two\ncontributions, we can apply all PL techniques to BO. In our third contribution\nwe validate this way of improving BO by demonstrating that cross-validation and\nbagging improve immediate sampling. Finally, conventional MC and MCO procedures\nignore the relationship between the sample point locations and the associated\nvalues of the integrand; only the values of the integrand at those locations\nare considered. We demonstrate that one can exploit the sample location\ninformation using PL techniques, for example by forming a fit of the sample\nlocations to the associated values of the integrand.

Electron and ion momentum\ndistributions after double ionization of a model Helium atom in a strong\nfew-cycle laser pulse are studied.

By comparison with the solution of the time-dependent Schroedinger\nequation, the insufficiency of functionals neglecting electron correlation is\ndemonstrated.

In both cases the response of the lithosphere to external\nforces can be calculated with the theory of thin elastic plates or shells. On\none-plate planets the spherical geometry of the lithospheric shell plays an\nimportant role in the flexure mechanism. So far the equations governing the\ndeformations and stresses of a spherical shell have only been derived under the\nassumption of a shell of constant thickness. However local studies of gravity\nand topography data suggest large variations in the thickness of the\nlithosphere. In this article we obtain the scalar flexure equations governing\nthe deformations of a thin spherical shell with variable thickness or variable\nYoung's modulus. The resulting equations can be solved in succession, except\nfor a system of two simultaneous equations, the solutions of which are the\ntransverse deflection and an associated stress function. In order to include\nbottom loading generated by mantle convection, we extend the method of stress\nfunctions to include loads with a toroidal tangential component. We further\nshow that toroidal tangential displacement always occurs if the shell thickness\nvaries, even in the absence of toroidal loads. We finally prove that the\ndegree-one harmonic components of the transverse deflection and of the toroidal\ntangential displacement are independent of the elastic properties of the shell\nand are associated with translational and rotational freedom. The flexure\nequations for a shell of variable thickness are useful not only for the\nprediction of the gravity signal in local admittance studies, but also for the\nconstruction of stress maps in tectonic analysis.\n",

In this paper, we describe a\nprobabilistic model of the user annotation process in a social bookmarking\nsystem del.icio.us. We then use the model to automatically find resources\nrelevant to a particular information domain. Our experimental results on data\nobtained from \\emph{del.icio.us} show this approach as a promising method for\nhelping automate the resource discovery task.\n",

    "title": "Personalizing Image Search Results on Flickr",
    "abstract": "  The social media site Flickr allows users to upload their photos, annotate\nthem with tags, submit them to groups, and also to form social networks by\nadding other users as contacts. Flickr offers multiple ways of browsing or\nsearching it. One option is tag search, which returns all images tagged with a\nspecific keyword. If the keyword is ambiguous, e.g., ``beetle'' could mean an\ninsect or a car, tag search results will include many images that are not\nrelevant to the sense the user had in mind when executing the query. We claim\nthat users express their photography interests through the metadata they add in\nthe form of contacts and image annotations. We show how to exploit this\nmetadata to personalize search results for the user, thereby improving search\nperformance. First, we show that we can significantly improve search precision\nby filtering tag search results by user's contacts or a larger social network\nthat includes those contact's contacts. Secondly, we describe a probabilistic\nmodel that takes advantage of tag information to discover latent topics\ncontained in the search results. The users' interests can similarly be\ndescribed by the tags they used for annotating their images. The latent topics\nfound by the model are then used to personalize search results by finding\nimages on topics that are of interest to the user.\n",

In this paper, we first present an unified view of these\nproofs, showing that they share two essential ingredients: 1) a data processing\nargument applied to a covariance-preserving linear transformation; 2) an\nintegration over a path of a continuous Gaussian perturbation. Using these\ningredients, we develop a new and brief proof of the EPI through a mutual\ninformation inequality, which replaces Stam and Blachman's Fisher information\ninequality (FII) and an inequality for MMSE by Guo, Shamai and Verd\\'u used in\nearlier proofs. The result has the advantage of being very simple in that it\nrelies only on the basic properties of mutual information. These ideas are then\ngeneralized to various extended versions of the EPI: Zamir and Feder's\ngeneralized EPI for linear transformations of the random variables, Takano and\nJohnson's EPI for dependent variables, Liu and Viswanath's\ncovariance-constrained EPI, and Costa's concavity inequality for the entropy\npower.\n",

Our analysis considers the fact that the distributed\nrandom access systems exhibit cyclic behavior where each station successfully\ntransmits a packet in a cycle. Our analysis shows that an AC-specific cycle\ntime exists for the EDCA function. Validating the theoretical results via\nsimulations, we show that the proposed analysis accurately captures EDCA\nsaturation performance in terms of average throughput, medium access delay, and\npacket loss ratio. The cycle time analysis is a simple and insightful\nsubstitute for previously proposed more complex EDCA models.\n",

The optical paths of every\nconstituent layer in a multilayer structure, as well as the parameters of every\nstep of the stepwise potential barrier, are constrained by a generalized\nquarter-wave condition. No other restrictions on the structure geometry is\nimposed, i.e., the layers are arranged arbitrarily.

    "abstract": "  We compute solutions of the Lagrangian-Averaged Navier-Stokes alpha-model\n(LANS) for significantly higher Reynolds numbers (up to Re 8300) than have\npreviously been accomplished. This allows sufficient separation of scales to\nobserve a Navier-Stokes (NS) inertial range followed by a 2nd LANS inertial\nrange. The analysis of the third-order structure function scaling supports the\npredicted l^3 scaling; it corresponds to a k^(-1) scaling of the energy\nspectrum. The energy spectrum itself shows a different scaling which goes as\nk^1. This latter spectrum is consistent with the absence of stretching in the\nsub-filter scales due to the Taylor frozen-in hypothesis employed as a closure\nin the derivation of LANS. These two scalings are conjectured to coexist in\ndifferent spatial portions of the flow. The l^3 (E(k) k^(-1)) scaling is\nsubdominant to k^1 in the energy spectrum, but the l^3 scaling is responsible\nfor the direct energy cascade, as no cascade can result from motions with no\ninternal degrees of freedom. We verify the prediction for the size of the LANS\nattractor resulting from this scaling. From this, we give a methodology either\nfor arriving at grid-independent solutions for LANS, or for obtaining a\nformulation of a LES optimal in the context of the alpha models. The fully\nconverged grid-independent LANS may not be the best approximation to a direct\nnumerical simulation of the NS equations since the minimum error is a balance\nbetween truncation errors and the approximation error due to using LANS instead\nof the primitive equations. Furthermore, the small-scale behavior of LANS\ncontributes to a reduction of flux at constant energy, leading to a shallower\nenergy spectrum for large alpha. These small-scale features, do not preclude\nLANS to reproduce correctly the intermittency properties of high Re flow.\n",

    "abstract": "  Contact electrification and triboelectrification are well-known in the case\nof dissimilar materials, however the case of charge exchange during friction\nbetween nominally identical insulating materials is less documented. We\nexperimentally investigated the triboelectrification between two smooth\nmonocrystalline &#945;-Al 2O 3 (sapphire) antagonists by surface force\nmeasurements with a Surface Force Apparatus (SFA). The force between a sphere\nand a plane, both in sapphire, was measured as a function of the sphere-plane\ndistance D, before and after nano-friction tests, under dry argon atmosphere.\nRespective contributions of van der Waals, water meniscus and electrostatic\nforces were determined. The estimated Hamaker constant was in good agreement\nwith the Lifshitz theory, and the dominant meniscus attraction at low\nseparation could be overcome with small radius sphere. We demonstrated that\nelectrostatic forces were generated by the nano-friction test and we quantified\nthe adhesion that results from this contact-electrification. In the first stage\nof the unloading process, the short range electrostatic force was found to vary\nboth with time and distance D. Experimental results were correlated with\nsurface densities of mobile charges on the two surfaces, and the\ntime-dependence was related to classical surface transport phenomena on alumina\nsurfaces.\n",

The two complementary problems are called MaxAgree and MinDisagree,\nrespectively, and have been studied on complete graphs, where every edge is\nlabeled, and general graphs, where some edge might not have been labeled.\nNatural edge-weighted versions of both problems have been studied as well. Let\nS-MaxAgree denote the weighted problem where all weights are taken from set S,\nwe show that S-MaxAgree with weights bounded by $O(|V|^{1/2-\\delta})$\nessentially belongs to the same hardness class in the following sense: if there\nis a polynomial time algorithm that approximates S-MaxAgree within a factor of\n$\\lambda = O(\\log{|V|})$ with high probability, then for any choice of S',\nS'-MaxAgree can be approximated in polynomial time within a factor of $(\\lambda\n+ \\epsilon)$, where $\\epsilon > 0$ can be arbitrarily small, with high\nprobability.

We use daily closing prices for the period 1996-2006, which coincides\nwith the period of rapid transformation of the market following liberalization.\nThe eigenvalue distribution of the cross-correlation matrix, $\\mathbf{C}$, of\nNSE is found to be similar to that of developed markets, such as the New York\nStock Exchange (NYSE): the majority of eigenvalues fall within the bounds\nexpected for a random matrix constructed from mutually uncorrelated time\nseries. Of the few largest eigenvalues that deviate from the bulk, the largest\nis identified with market-wide movements. The intermediate eigenvalues that\noccur between the largest and the bulk have been associated in NYSE with\nspecific business sectors with strong intra-group interactions. However, in the\nIndian market, these deviating eigenvalues are comparatively very few and lie\nmuch closer to the bulk. We propose that this is because of the relative lack\nof distinct sector identity in the market, with the movement of stocks\ndominantly influenced by the overall market trend. This is shown by explicit\nconstruction of the interaction network in the market, first by generating the\nminimum spanning tree from the unfiltered correlation matrix, and later, using\nan improved method of generating the graph after filtering out the market mode\nand random effects from the data. Both methods show, compared to developed\nmarkets, the relative absence of clusters of co-moving stocks that belong to\nthe same business sector.

Unlike previous works, where a\nnoiseless public discussion channel is used for feedback, the feed-forward and\nfeedback signals share the same noisy channel in the present model. Quite\ninterestingly, this noisy feedback model is shown to be more advantageous in\nthe current setting. More specifically, the discrete memoryless modulo-additive\nchannel with a full-duplex destination node is considered first, and it is\nshown that the judicious use of feedback increases the perfect secrecy capacity\nto the capacity of the source-destination channel in the absence of the\nwiretapper. In the achievability scheme, the feedback signal corresponds to a\nprivate key, known only to the destination. In the half-duplex scheme, a novel\nfeedback technique that always achieves a positive perfect secrecy rate (even\nwhen the source-wiretapper channel is less noisy than the source-destination\nchannel) is proposed. These results hinge on the modulo-additive property of\nthe channel, which is exploited by the destination to perform encryption over\nthe channel without revealing its key to the source. Finally, this scheme is\nextended to the continuous real valued modulo-$\\Lambda$ channel where it is\nshown that the perfect secrecy capacity with feedback is also equal to the\ncapacity in the absence of the wiretapper.\n",

It\nencompasses as particular cases several models from the sociology and economics\nliterature. We extend previous results to the case of a general distribution of\nidiosyncratic preferences, called here Idiosyncratic Willingnesses to Pay\n(IWP). Positive additive externalities yield a family of inverse demand curves\nthat include the classical downward sloping ones but also new ones with non\nconstant convexity. When j, the ratio of the social influence strength to the\nstandard deviation of the IWP distribution, is small enough, the inverse demand\nis a classical monotonic (decreasing) function of the adoption rate. Even if\nthe IWP distribution is mono-modal, there is a critical value of j above which\nthe inverse demand is non monotonic, decreasing for small and high adoption\nrates, but increasing within some intermediate range. Depending on the price\nthere are thus either one or two equilibria. Beyond this first result, we\nexhibit the generic properties of the boundaries limiting the regions where the\nsystem presents different types of equilibria (unique or multiple). These\nproperties are shown to depend only on qualitative features of the IWP\ndistribution: modality (number of maxima), smoothness and type of support\n(compact or infinite).

Rather than a blessing, this feature is treated more as\nan interference-inducing nuisance in most wireless networks today (e.g., IEEE\n802.11). This paper shows that the concept of network coding can be applied at\nthe physical layer to turn the broadcast property into a capacity-boosting\nadvantage in wireless ad hoc networks. Specifically, we propose a\nphysical-layer network coding (PNC) scheme to coordinate transmissions among\nnodes. In contrast to straightforward network coding which performs coding\narithmetic on digital bit streams after they have been received, PNC makes use\nof the additive nature of simultaneously arriving electromagnetic (EM) waves\nfor equivalent coding operation.

In this paper, the maximal rate (as measured in complex\nsymbols per channel use) of CUW codes for $\\lambda=2^a,a\\in\\mathbb{N}$ is\nobtained using tools from representation theory. Two algebraic constructions of\ncodes achieving this maximal rate are also provided. One of the constructions\nis obtained using linear representation of finite groups whereas the other\nconstruction is based on the concept of right module algebra over\nnon-commutative rings. To the knowledge of the authors, this is the first paper\nin which matrices over non-commutative rings is used to construct STBCs. An\nalgebraic explanation is provided for the 'ABBA' construction first proposed by\nTirkkonen et al and the tensor product construction proposed by Karmakar et al.\nFurthermore, it is established that the 4 transmit antenna STBC originally\nproposed by Tirkkonen et al based on the ABBA construction is actually a single\ncomplex symbol ML decodable code if the design variables are permuted and\nsignal sets of appropriate dimensions are chosen.\n",

It does not require long-distance freshwater transportation. If seawater\nis not utilized for increasing its productivity, this inexpensive new method is\nvery environment-friendly. The author method has two working versions: (1) the\nfirst variant the warm (hot) atmospheric air is lifted by the inflatable tube\nin a high altitude and atmospheric steam is condenced into freswater: (2) in\nthe second version, the warm air is pumped 20-30 meters under the sea-surface.\nIn the first version, wind and solar heating of air are used for causing air\nflow. In version (2) wind and propeller are used for causing air movment.\n  The first method does not need energy, the second needs a small amount.\nMoreover, in variant (1) the freshwater has a high pressure (>30 or more atm.)\nand can be used for production of energy such as electricity and in that way\nthe freshwater cost is lower. For increasing the productivity the seawater is\ninjected into air and solar air heater may be used.

The source is coded\nin superimposed layers, with each layer successively refining the description\nin the previous one. The receiver decodes the layers that are supported by the\nchannel realization and reconstructs the source up to a distortion. In the\nlimit of a continuum of infinite layers, the optimal power distribution that\nminimizes the expected distortion is given by the solution to a set of linear\ndifferential equations in terms of the density of the fading distribution. In\nthe optimal power distribution, as SNR increases, the allocation over the\nhigher layers remains unchanged; rather the extra power is allocated towards\nthe lower layers. On the other hand, as the bandwidth ratio b (channel uses per\nsource symbol) tends to zero, the power distribution that minimizes expected\ndistortion converges to the power distribution that maximizes expected\ncapacity. While expected distortion can be improved by acquiring CSI at the\ntransmitter (CSIT) or by increasing diversity from the realization of\nindependent fading paths, at high SNR the performance benefit from diversity\nexceeds that from CSIT, especially when b is large.\n",

Coal-fired power plants without\nsequestration must be phased out before mid-century to achieve this CO2 limit.\nIt is also important to \"stretch\" conventional oil reserves via energy\nconservation and efficiency, thus averting strong pressures to extract liquid\nfuels from coal or unconventional fossil fuels while clean technologies are\nbeing developed for the era \"beyond fossil fuels\". We argue that a rising price\non carbon emissions is needed to discourage conversion of the vast fossil\nresources into usable reserves, and to keep CO2 beneath the 450 ppm ceiling.\n",

The achievable rate of Costa's dirty paper coding (DPC)\nscheme is calculated and compared to the case of the decoder's also knowing the\ndirt. In the ergodic case, the corresponding rate loss vanishes asymptotically\nin the limits of both high and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and is small at\nall finite SNR for typical distributions like Rayleigh, Rician, and Nakagami.\nIn the quasi-static case, the DPC scheme is lossless at all SNR in terms of\noutage probability. Quasi-static fading broadcast channels (BC) without\ntransmit channel state information (CSI) are investigated as an application of\nthe robustness properties. It is shown that the DPC scheme leads to an outage\nachievable rate region that strictly dominates that of time division.\n",

In fact, they\noften make headlines, by discussing and discovering evidence about political\nevents and facts. Often blogs link to one another, creating a publicly\navailable record of how information and influence spreads through an underlying\nsocial network.

In recent work, Ochiai, et al., have shown that such collaborative\nbeamforming can achieve a statistically nice beampattern with a narrow main\nlobe and low sidelobes. However, the process of collaboration introduces\nsignificant delay, since all collaborating nodes need access to the same\ninformation. In this paper, a technique that significantly reduces the\ncollaboration overhead is proposed. It consists of two phases. In the first\nphase, nodes transmit locally in a random access fashion. Collisions, when they\noccur, are viewed as linear mixtures of the collided packets. In the second\nphase, a set of cooperating nodes acts as a distributed antenna system and\nbeamform the received analog waveform to one or more faraway destinations. This\nstep requires multiplication of the received analog waveform by a complex\nnumber, which is independently computed by each cooperating node, and which\nenables separation of the collided packets based on their final destination.\nThe scheme requires that each node has global knowledge of the network\ncoordinates. The proposed scheme can achieve high throughput, which in certain\ncases exceeds one.\n",

Origination and extinction intensity as defined by RM\nmay be affected by an artifact at 27 Myr in the duration of stratigraphic\nintervals.

    "abstract": "  In this paper, it is shown that the cosmological model that was introduced in\na sequence of three earlier papers under the title, A Dust Universe Solution to\nthe Dark Energy Problem, can be used to resolve the problem of the great\nmismatch of numerical values between dark energy from cosmology and zero point\nenergy from quantum theory. It is shown that, if the zero point energies for\nthe cosmic microwave background and for all the rest of the universe that is\nnot cosmic microwave background are introduced into this model as two entities,\ntheir separate values appear within this theory in the form of a numerical\ndifference. It is this difference that gives the numerical value for the zero\npoint value of Einstein's dark energy density. Consequently, although the two\nzero point energies may be large, their difference can give the known small\ndark energy value from cosmology for dark energy density. Issues relating to\ninterpretation, calculation and measurement associated with this result and an\ninterpretation of dark energy as a measure of polarisation of the vacuum are\ndiscussed. In the first appendix to this paper, problems associated with the\nstandard model of cosmology are solved by redefining temperature in the dust\nuniverse model. In the second appendix of this paper, an examination of the\ndark matter problem in relation to a general relativistic generalisation of\nNewton's inverse square law is undertaken.

Applications\nto real life situations in which two-sided changes can occur are discussed.\nTraditionally, 2-CUSUM stopping rules have been used for this problem due to\ntheir asymptotically optimal character as the mean time between false alarms\ntends to $\\infty$. In particular, attention has focused on 2-CUSUM harmonic\nmean rules due to the simplicity in calculating their first moments. In this\npaper, we derive closed-form expressions for the first moment of a general\n2-CUSUM stopping rule. We use these expressions to obtain explicit upper and\nlower bounds for it. Moreover, we derive an expression for the rate of change\nof this first moment as one of the threshold parameters changes. Based on these\nexpressions we obtain explicit upper and lower bounds to this rate of change.\nUsing these expressions we are able to find the best 2-CUSUM stopping rule with\nrespect to the extended Lorden criterion. In fact, we demonstrate not only the\nexistence but also the uniqueness of the best 2-CUSUM stopping both in the case\nof a symmetric change and in the case of a non-symmetric case. Furthermore, we\ndiscuss the existence of a modification of the 2-CUSUM stopping rule that has a\nstrictly better performance than its classical 2-CUSUM counterpart for small\nvalues of the mean time between false alarms.

The stability condition for GLDPC codes is always expressed\nas an upper bound to the decoding threshold. This is not possible for D-GLDPC\ncodes, unless all the generalized variable nodes have minimum distance at least\n3. Furthermore, a condition called derivative matching is defined in the paper.\nThis condition is sufficient for a GLDPC or DGLDPC code to achieve the\nstability condition with equality. If this condition is satisfied, the\nthreshold of D-GLDPC codes (whose generalized variable nodes have all minimum\ndistance at least 3) and GLDPC codes can be expressed in closed form.\n",

To\novercome this problem, an approach based on coalition games is proposed, in\nwhich the boundary nodes can use cooperative transmission to help the backbone\nnodes in the middle of the network. In return, the backbone nodes are willing\nto forward the boundary nodes' packets. The stability of the coalitions is\nstudied using the concept of a core. Then two types of fairness, namely, the\nmin-max fairness using nucleolus and the average fairness using the Shapley\nfunction are investigated.

    "title": "Lifetime Improvement of Wireless Sensor Networks by Collaborative\n  Beamforming and Cooperative Transmission",
    "abstract": "  Extending network lifetime of battery-operated devices is a key design issue\nthat allows uninterrupted information exchange among distributive nodes in\nwireless sensor networks. Collaborative beamforming (CB) and cooperative\ntransmission (CT) have recently emerged as new communication techniques that\nenable and leverage effective resource sharing among collaborative/cooperative\nnodes. In this paper, we seek to maximize the lifetime of sensor networks by\nusing the new idea that closely located nodes can use CB/CT to reduce the load\nor even avoid packet forwarding requests to nodes that have critical battery\nlife. First, we study the effectiveness of CB/CT to improve the signal strength\nat a faraway destination using energy in nearby nodes. Then, a 2D disk case is\nanalyzed to assess the resulting performance improvement. For general networks,\nif information-generation rates are fixed, the new routing problem is\nformulated as a linear programming problem; otherwise, the cost for routing is\ndynamically adjusted according to the amount of energy remaining and the\neffectiveness of CB/CT. From the analysis and simulation results, it is seen\nthat the proposed schemes can improve the lifetime by about 90% in the 2D disk\nnetwork and by about 10% in the general networks, compared to existing schemes.\n",

However, due to low\nspectral efficiency and the requirement of orthogonal channels, its potential\nfor use in future wireless networks is limited. In this paper, by making use of\nmultiuser detection (MUD) and network coding, cooperative transmission\nprotocols with high spectral efficiency, diversity order, and coding gain are\ndeveloped. Compared with the traditional cooperative transmission protocols\nwith single-user detection, in which the diversity gain is only for one source\nuser, the proposed MUD cooperative transmission protocols have the merits that\nthe improvement of one user's link can also benefit the other users. In\naddition, using MUD at the relay provides an environment in which network\ncoding can be employed.

It is assumed that a group of sensors observe the same\nquantity in independent additive observation noises with possibly different\nvariances. The observations are transmitted using amplify-and-forward (analog)\ntransmissions over non-ideal fading wireless channels from the sensors to a\nfusion center, where they are combined to generate an estimate of the observed\nquantity. Assuming that the Best Linear Unbiased Estimator (BLUE) is used by\nthe fusion center, the equal-power transmission strategy is first discussed,\nwhere the system performance is analyzed by introducing the concept of\nestimation outage and estimation diversity, and it is shown that there is an\nachievable diversity gain on the order of the number of sensors. The optimal\npower allocation strategies are then considered for two cases: minimum\ndistortion under power constraints; and minimum power under distortion\nconstraints. In the first case, it is shown that by turning off bad sensors,\ni.e., sensors with bad channels and bad observation quality, adaptive power\ngain can be achieved without sacrificing diversity gain. Here, the adaptive\npower gain is similar to the array gain achieved in Multiple-Input\nSingle-Output (MISO) multi-antenna systems when channel conditions are known to\nthe transmitter.

Because the comb is self-calibrating and can be shifted into\nthe ultraviolet spectral region via harmonic generation, it offers the prospect\nof greatly improved accuracy for UV and far-UV transitions. To take advantage\nof this accuracy an ultracold helium sample is needed. For measurements of the\ntriplet spectrum a magneto-optical trap (MOT) can be used to cool and trap\nmetastable 2^3S state atoms. We analyze schemes for measuring the two-photon\n$2^3S \\to 4^3S$ interval, and for resonant two-photon excitation to high\nRydberg states, $2^3S \\to 3^3P \\to n^3S,D$. We also analyze experiments on the\nsinglet-state spectrum. To accomplish this we propose schemes for producing and\ntrapping ultracold helium in the 1^1S or 2^1S state via intercombination\ntransitions. A particularly intriguing scenario is the possibility of measuring\nthe $1^1S \\to 2^1S$ transition with extremely high accuracy by use of\ntwo-photon excitation in a magic wavelength trap that operates identically for\nboth states. We predict a ``triple magic wavelength'' at 412 nm that could\nfacilitate numerous experiments on trapped helium atoms, because here the\npolarizabilities of the 1^1S, 2^1S and 2^3S states are all similar, small, and\npositive.\n",

    "abstract": "  In this paper we address the problem of finding the sensing capacity of\nsensor networks for a class of linear observation models and a fixed SNR\nregime. Sensing capacity is defined as the maximum number of signal dimensions\nreliably identified per sensor observation. In this context sparsity of the\nphenomena is a key feature that determines sensing capacity. Precluding the SNR\nof the environment the effect of sparsity on the number of measurements\nrequired for accurate reconstruction of a sparse phenomena has been widely\ndealt with under compressed sensing. Nevertheless the development there was\nmotivated from an algorithmic perspective. In this paper our aim is to derive\nthese bounds in an information theoretic set-up and thus provide algorithm\nindependent conditions for reliable reconstruction of sparse signals. In this\ndirection we first generalize the Fano's inequality and provide lower bounds to\nthe probability of error in reconstruction subject to an arbitrary distortion\ncriteria. Using these lower bounds to the probability of error, we derive upper\nbounds to sensing capacity and show that for fixed SNR regime sensing capacity\ngoes down to zero as sparsity goes down to zero. This means that\ndisproportionately more sensors are required to monitor very sparse events. Our\nnext main contribution is that we show the effect of sensing diversity on\nsensing capacity, an effect that has not been considered before. Sensing\ndiversity is related to the effective \\emph{coverage} of a sensor with respect\nto the field. In this direction we show the following results (a) Sensing\ncapacity goes down as sensing diversity per sensor goes down; (b) Random\nsampling (coverage) of the field by sensors is better than contiguous location\nsampling (coverage).\n",

    "title": "Modelling diffusional transport in the interphase cell nucleus",
    "abstract": "  In this paper a lattice model for diffusional transport of particles in the\ninterphase cell nucleus is proposed. Dense networks of chromatin fibers are\ncreated by three different methods: randomly distributed, non-interconnected\nobstacles, a random walk chain model, and a self avoiding random walk chain\nmodel with persistence length. By comparing a discrete and a continuous version\nof the random walk chain model, we demonstrate that lattice discretization does\nnot alter particle diffusion. The influence of the 3D geometry of the fiber\nnetwork on the particle diffusion is investigated in detail, while varying\noccupation volume, chain length, persistence length and walker size. It is\nshown that adjacency of the monomers, the excluded volume effect incorporated\nin the self avoiding random walk model, and, to a lesser extent, the\npersistence length, affect particle diffusion. It is demonstrated how the\nintroduction of the effective chain occupancy, which is a convolution of the\ngeometric chain volume with the walker size, eliminates the conformational\neffects of the network on the diffusion, i.e., when plotting the diffusion\ncoefficient as a function of the effective chain volume, the data fall onto a\nmaster curve.\n",

In this study we\npresent a computational reconstruction approach to the problem of network\norganization, by considering the topological and spatial features of each area\nin the primate cerebral cortex as subsidy for the reconstruction of the global\ncortical network connectivity. Starting with all areas being disconnected,\npairs of areas with similar sets of features are linked together, in an attempt\nto recover the original network structure. Inferring primate cortical\nconnectivity from the properties of the nodes, remarkably good reconstructions\nof the global network organization could be obtained, with the topological\nfeatures allowing slightly superior accuracy to the spatial ones. Analogous\nreconstruction attempts for the C. elegans neuronal network resulted in\nsubstantially poorer recovery, indicating that cortical area interconnections\nare relatively stronger related to the considered topological and spatial\nproperties than neuronal projections in the nematode. The close relationship\nbetween area-based features and global connectivity may hint on developmental\nrules and constraints for cortical networks. Particularly, differences between\nthe predictions from topological and spatial properties, together with the\npoorer recovery resulting from spatial properties, indicate that the\norganization of cortical networks is not entirely determined by spatial\nconstraints.\n",

    "abstract": "  Two approaches for closing the turbulence subgrid-scale stress tensor in\nterms of matrix exponentials are introduced and compared. The first approach is\nbased on a formal solution of the stress transport equation in which the\nproduction terms can be integrated exactly in terms of matrix exponentials.\nThis formal solution of the subgrid-scale stress transport equation is shown to\nbe useful to explore special cases, such as the response to constant velocity\ngradient, but neglecting pressure-strain correlations and diffusion effects.\nThe second approach is based on an Eulerian-Lagrangian change of variables,\ncombined with the assumption of isotropy for the conditionally averaged\nLagrangian velocity gradient tensor and with the `Recent Fluid Deformation'\n(RFD) approximation. It is shown that both approaches lead to the same basic\nclosure in which the stress tensor is expressed as the product of the matrix\nexponential of the resolved velocity gradient tensor multiplied by its\ntranspose. Short-time expansions of the matrix exponentials are shown to\nprovide an eddy-viscosity term and particular quadratic terms, and thus allow a\nreinterpretation of traditional eddy-viscosity and nonlinear stress closures.\nThe basic feasibility of the matrix-exponential closure is illustrated by\nimplementing it successfully in Large Eddy Simulation of forced isotropic\nturbulence. The matrix-exponential closure employs the drastic approximation of\nentirely omitting the pressure-strain correlation and other `nonlinear\nscrambling' terms. But unlike eddy-viscosity closures, the matrix exponential\napproach provides a simple and local closure that can be derived directly from\nthe stress transport equation with the production term, and using physically\nmotivated assumptions about Lagrangian decorrelation and upstream isotropy.\n",

    "abstract": "  Interaction between metal surface waves and periodic geometry of\nsubwavelength structures is at the core of the recent but crucial renewal of\ninterest in plasmonics. One of the most intriguing points is the observation of\nabnormal strong transmission through these periodic structures, which can\nexceed by orders of magnitude the classical transmission given by the filling\nfactor of the plate. The actual paradigm is that this abnormal transmission\narises from the periodicity, and then that such high transmission should\ndisappear in random geometries. Here, we show that extra energy can be coupled\nthrough the subwavelength structure by adding a controlled quantity of noise to\nthe position of the apertures. This result can be modelled in the statistical\nframework of stochastic resonance. The evolution of the coupled energy with\nrespect to noise gives access to the extra energy coupled at the surface of the\nsubwavelength array.\n",

The computed distributions remarkably agree with the\nworm-like chain theory for double helices of one helical turn and longer, and\nqualitatively differ from predictions of the semi-elastic chain model. The\ncomputed data exhibit only small anomalies in the apparent flexibility of short\nDNA and cannot account for the recently reported AFM data (Wiggins et al,\nNature nanotechnology 1, 137 (2006)). It is possible that the current atomistic\nDNA models miss some essential mechanisms of DNA bending on intermediate length\nscales. Analysis of bent DNA structures reveals, however, that the bending\nmotion is structurally heterogeneous and directionally anisotropic on the\nintermediate length scales where the experimental anomalies were detected.\nThese effects are essential for interpretation of the experimental data and\nthey also can be responsible for the apparent discrepancy.\n",

The main concern of this work is to design relaying\nstrategies that utilize efficiently the relays in such a way that the diversity\nis maximized. In part I, we focus on the amplify-and-forward (AF) strategy with\nwhich the relays simply scale the received signal and retransmit it. More\nspecifically, we characterize the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) of the\nAF scheme in a general multihop channel with arbitrary number of antennas and\narbitrary number of hops. The DMT is in closed-form expression as a function of\nthe number of antennas at each node. First, we provide some basic results on\nthe DMT of the general Rayleigh product channels. It turns out that these\nresults have very simple and intuitive interpretation. Then, the results are\napplied to the AF multihop channels which is shown to be equivalent to the\nRayleigh product channel, in the DMT sense. Finally, the project-and-forward\n(PF) scheme, a variant of the AF scheme, is proposed. We show that the PF\nscheme has the same DMT as the AF scheme, while the PF can have significant\npower gain over the AF scheme in some cases. In part II, we will derive the\nupper bound on the diversity of the multihop channels and show that it can be\nachieved by partitioning the multihop channel into AF subchannels.\n",

It is shown that for Si- and C-sensors, the NIEL hypothesis,\nwhich states that the signal loss is proportional to the Non-Ionizing Energy\nLoss, is a good approximation to the present data. At incident proton and\nneutron energies well above 0.1 GeV the radiation damage is dominated by the\ninelastic cross section, while at non-relativistic energies the elastic cross\nsection prevails. The smaller inelastic nucleon-Carbon cross section and the\nlight nuclear fragments imply that at high energies diamond is an order of\nmagnitude more radiation hard than silicon, while at energies below 0.1 GeV the\ndifference becomes significantly smaller.\n",

It sheds new light on the age old problem by thinking of the traditional\nalgorithms as working with images. Inspiration is drawn from an analogous\nsituation that is found in machine and human vision. Image processing\ntechniques are used to assist in the spatial indexing of the data. A fixed grid\napproach is used and bins with too many records are sub-divided hierarchically.\nSearch queries are pre-computed for bins that do not contain any data records.\nThis has the effect of dividing the search space up into non rectangular\nregions which are based on the spatial properties of the data. The bucketing\nquad tree can be considered as an image with a resolution of two by two for\neach layer. The results show that this method performs better than the quad\ntree if there are more divisions per layer. This confirms our suspicions that\nthe algorithm works better if it gets to look at the data with higher\nresolution images. An elegant class structure is developed where the\nimplementation of concrete spatial indexes for a particular data type merely\nrelies on rendering the data onto an image.\n",

This thermodynamic\ndescription sheds new light on the dynamics of particles in time-varying\nconfining potentials. It specifically allows us to extract the effective depth\nof the ion trap as the activation energy for evaporation. As a function of the\nrf amplitude we find two distinct regimes related to the stability of motion of\nthe trapped ions. For low amplitudes the entire trap allows for stable motion\nand the trap depth increases with the rf field. For larger rf amplitudes,\nhowever, rapid energy transfer from the field to the ion motion can occur at\nlarge trap radii, which leads to a reduction of the effective trapping volume.\nIn this regime the trap depth decreases again with increasing rf amplitude. We\ngive an analytical parameterization of the trap depth for various multipole\ntraps that allows predictions of the most favorable trapping conditions.\n",

Vibration-induced conductivity fluctuation was investigated to\nquantify soil bulk density with possible field applications in the future. The\nAC electrical conductivity of soil was measured using a pair of blade-like\nelectrodes while exposing the soil to periodic vibration. The blades were\npositioned longitudinally and transversally to the direction of the induced\nvibration to enable the calculation of a normalized index. The normalized index\nwas expected to provide data independent from the vibration strength and to\nreduce the effect of soil salinity and water content. The experiment was\nconducted on natural and salinized fine sand at two moisture conditions and\nfour bulk densities. The blade-shaped electrodes improved electrode-soil\ncontact compared to cylindrical electrodes, and thereby, reduced measurement\nnoise. Simulations on a simplified resistor lattice indicate that the\ntransversal effect increases as soil bulk density decreases. Measurement of dry\nsand showed a negative correlation between the normalized conductivity\nfluctuation and soil bulk density for both longitudinal and transversal\nsettings. The decrease in the transversal signal was smaller than expected. The\nwet natural and salinized soils performed very similarly as hypothesized, but\ntheir normalized VICOF response was not significant to bulk density changes.\n",

    "abstract": "  One way of getting a better view of data is using frequent patterns. In this\npaper frequent patterns are subsets that occur a minimal number of times in a\nstream of itemsets. However, the discovery of frequent patterns in streams has\nalways been problematic. Because streams are potentially endless it is in\nprinciple impossible to say if a pattern is often occurring or not. Furthermore\nthe number of patterns can be huge and a good overview of the structure of the\nstream is lost quickly. The proposed approach will use clustering to facilitate\nthe analysis of the structure of the stream.\n  A clustering on the co-occurrence of patterns will give the user an improved\nview on the structure of the stream. Some patterns might occur so much together\nthat they should form a combined pattern. In this way the patterns in the\nclustering will be the largest frequent patterns: maximal frequent patterns.\n  Our approach to decide if patterns occur often together will be based on a\nmethod of clustering when only the distance between pairs is known. The number\nof maximal frequent patterns is much smaller and combined with clustering\nmethods these patterns provide a good view on the structure of the stream.\n",

Lattice information\nis provided by the graph mining algorithm gSpan; it contains all\nsupergraph-subgraph relations of the frequent subgraph patterns -- and their\nsupports.\n  Lattice2SAR is in particular used in the analysis of frequent graph patterns\nwhere the graphs are molecules and the frequent subgraphs are fragments. In the\nanalysis of fragments one is interested in the molecules where patterns occur.\nThis data can be very extensive and in this paper we focus on a technique of\nmaking it better available by using the lattice information in our clustering.\nNow we can reduce the number of times the highly compressed occurrence data\nneeds to be accessed by the user. The user does not have to browse all the\noccurrence data in search of patterns occurring in the same molecules. Instead\none can directly see which frequent subgraphs are of interest.\n",

In this paper we shall introduce a novel approach to\ncompute risk functions by using a combination of a highly non-linear processing\nmodel in conjunction with a powerful information encoding procedure.\nSpecifically, the elements of information either static or dynamic that appear\nin a road intersection scene are encoded by using directed positional acyclic\nlabeled graphs. The risk assessment problem is then reformulated in terms of an\ninductive learning task carried out by a recursive neural network. Recursive\nneural networks are connectionist models capable of solving supervised and\nnon-supervised learning problems represented by directed ordered acyclic\ngraphs. The potential of this novel approach is demonstrated through well\npredefined scenarios. The major difference of our approach compared to others\nis expressed by the fact of learning the structure of the risk. Furthermore,\nthe combination of a rich information encoding procedure with a generalized\nmodel of dynamical recurrent networks permit us, as we shall demonstrate, a\nsophisticated processing of information that we believe as being a first step\nfor building future advanced intersection safety systems\n",

A complete basis of homogeneous solutions for the interior and\nexterior regions, corresponding to all possible Dirichlet boundary values at\nthe interface, are calculated in a preprocessing step. This basis is used to\nconstruct the influence matrix which serves to transform the coupled boundary\nconditions into conditions on the interior problem. Chebyshev approximations\nare used to represent both the interior solutions and the boundary values. A\nstandard Chebyshev spectral method is used to calculate the interior solutions.\nThe exterior harmonic solutions are calculated as the convolution of the\nfree-space Green's function with a surface density; this surface density is\nitself the solution to an integral equation which has an analytic solution when\nthe boundary values are given as a Chebyshev expansion. Properties of Chebyshev\napproximations insure that the basis of exterior harmonic functions represents\nthe external near-boundary solutions uniformly. The method is tested by\ncalculating the electrostatic potential resulting from charge distributions in\na rectangle. The resulting influence matrix is well-conditioned and solutions\nconverge exponentially as the resolution is increased.

Of these, even fewer provide exact ``necessary\nand sufficient'' characterizations.\n  In this paper we investigate the problem of using max-product to find the\nmaximum weight matching in an arbitrary graph with edge weights.

Second, the non-physical discontinuous boundary conditions at the\ncylindrical corners are smoothed using a polynomial approximation to a steep\nexponential profile. Third, the nonlinear term is evaluated in such a way as to\neliminate singularities. The resulting pseudo-spectral code is tested using\nexact polynomial solutions and the spectral convergence of the coefficients is\ndemonstrated. Our solutions are shown to agree with exact polynomial solutions\nand with previous axisymmetric calculations of vortex breakdown and of\nnonaxisymmetric calculations of onset of helical spirals.

In a plasma wake wave generated by such a laser,\nmodulations of the electron density naturally and robustly take the shape of\nparaboloidal dense shells, separated by evacuated regions, moving almost at the\nspeed of light. When we inject another counter-propagating laser pulse, it is\npartially reflected from the shells, acting as relativistic flying\n(semi-transparent) mirrors, producing an extremely time-compressed\nfrequency-multiplied pulse which may be focused tightly to the diffraction\nlimit. This is as if the counterstreaming laser pulse bounces off a\nrelativistically swung tennis racket, turning the ball of the laser photons\ninto another ball of coherent X-ray photons but with a form extremely\nrelativistically compressed to attosecond and zeptosecond levels. Here we\nreport the first demonstration of the frequency multiplication detected from\nthe reflection of a weak laser pulse in the region of the wake wave generated\nby the driver pulse in helium plasma. This leads to the possibility of very\nstrong pulse compression and extreme coherent light intensification. This\nRelativistic Tennis with photon beams is demonstrated leading to the\npossibility toward reaching enormous electromagnetic field intensification and\nfinally approaching the Schwinger field, toward which the vacuum nonlinearly\nwarps and eventually breaks, producing electron-positron pairs.\n",

    "abstract": "  This paper shows how the exposure of the Moon to the Earth's plasmasheet is\nsubject to decadal variations due to lunar precession. The latter is a key\nproperty of the Moon's apparent orbit around the Earth - the nodes of that\norbit precess around the ecliptic, completing one revolution every 18.6 years.\nThis precession is responsible for a number of astronomical phenomena, e.g. the\nyear to year drift of solar and lunar eclipse periods. It also controls the\necliptic latitude at which the Moon crosses the magnetotail and thus the number\nand duration of lunar encounters with the plasmasheet. This paper presents a\ndetailed model of those encounters and applies it to the period 1960 to 2030.\nThis shows that the total lunar exposure to the plasmasheet will vary from 10\nhours per month at a minimum of the eighteen-year cycle rising to 40 hours per\nmonth at the maximum. These variations could have a profound impact on the\naccumulation of charge due plasmasheet electrons impacting the lunar surface.\nThus we should expect the level of lunar surface charging to vary over the\neighteen-year cycle. The literature contains reports that support this: several\nobservations made during the cycle maximum of 1994-2000 are attributed to\nbombardment and charging of the lunar surface by plasmasheet electrons. Thus we\nconclude that lunar surface charging will vary markedly over an eighteen-year\ncycle driven by lunar precession. It is important to interpret lunar\nenvironment measurements in the context of this cycle and to allow for the\ncycle when designing equipment for deployment on the lunar surface. This is\nparticularly important in respect of developing plans for robotic exploration\non the lunar surface during the next cycle maximum of 2012-19.\n",

In opposite to serial\nmanipulators, parallel manipulators can admit not only multiple inverse\nkinematic solutions, but also multiple direct kinematic solutions. This\nproperty produces more complicated kinematic models but allows more flexibility\nin trajectory planning. To take into account this property, the notion of\naspects, i.e. the maximal singularity-free domains, was introduced, based on\nthe notion of working modes, which makes it possible to separate the inverse\nkinematic solutions. The aim of this paper is to show that a non-singular\nassembly-mode changing trajectory exist for a symmetrical planar parallel\nmanipulator, with equilateral base and platform triangle.\n",

    "abstract": "  This paper focuses on the kinematic properties of a new\nthree-degree-of-freedom hybrid manipulator. This manipulator is obtained by\nadding in series to a five-bar planar mechanism (similar to the one studied by\nBajpai and Roth) a third revolute passing through the line of centers of the\ntwo actuated revolute joints of the above linkage. The resulting architecture\nis hybrid in that it has both serial and parallel links. Fully-parallel\nmanipulators are known for the existence of particularly undesirable\nsingularities (referred to as parallel singularities) where control is lost [4]\nand [6]. On the other hand, due to their cantilever type of kinematic\narrangement, fully serial manipulators suffer from a lack of stiffness and from\nrelatively large positioning errors. The hybrid manipulator studied is\nintrinsically stiffer and more accurate. Furthermore, since all actuators are\nlocated on the first axis, the inertial effects are considerably reduced. In\naddition, it is shown that the special kinematic structure of our manipulator\nhas the potential of avoiding parallel singularities by a suitable choice of\nthe \"working mode\", thus leading to larger workspaces. The influence of the\ndifferent structural dimensions (e.g. the link lengths) on the kinematic and\nmechanical properties are analysed in view of the optimal design of such hybrid\nmanipulators.\n",

In one important mesh\nprimitive, called a mesh update, each mesh vertex stores a value and repeatedly\nupdates this value based on the values stored in all neighboring vertices. The\nperformance of a mesh update depends on the layout of the mesh in memory.\n  This paper shows how to find a memory layout that guarantees that the mesh\nupdate has asymptotically optimal memory performance for any set of memory\nparameters. Such a memory layout is called cache-oblivious. Formally, for a\n$d$-dimensional mesh $G$, block size $B$, and cache size $M$ (where\n$M=\\Omega(B^d)$), the mesh update of $G$ uses $O(1+|G|/B)$ memory transfers.\nThe paper also shows how the mesh-update performance degrades for smaller\ncaches, where $M=o(B^d)$.\n  The paper then gives two algorithms for finding cache-oblivious mesh layouts.\nThe first layout algorithm runs in time $O(|G|\\log^2|G|)$ both in expectation\nand with high probability on a RAM.

High Speed Machining highlights some drawbacks of such\narchitectures: heavy moving parts require from the machine structure high\nstiffness to limit bending problems that lower the machine accuracy, and limit\nthe dynamic performances of the feed axes. That is why PKMs attract more and\nmore researchers and companies, because they are claimed to offer several\nadvantages over their serial counterparts, like high structural rigidity and\nhigh dynamic capacities. Indeed, the parallel kinematic arrangement of the\nlinks provides higher stiffness and lower moving masses that reduce inertia\neffects. Thus, PKMs have better dynamic performances. However, the design of a\nparallel kinematic machine tool (PKMT) is a hard task that requires further\nresearch studies before wide industrial use can be expected.

In order to\ninvestigate this phenomenon we present a simple hybrid cellular automaton model\nof cell colony growth. In the model the growth of the colony is limited by a\nnutrient that is consumed by the cells and which inhibits cell division if it\nfalls below a certain threshold. Using this model we have investigated how the\nnutrient consumption rate of the cells affects the growth dynamics of the\ncolony. We found that for low consumption rates the colony takes on a Eden-like\nmorphology, while for higher consumption rates the morphology of the colony is\nbranched with a fractal geometry. These findings are in agreement with previous\nresults, but the simplicity of the model presented here allows for a linear\nstability analysis of the system. By observing that the local growth of the\ncolony is proportional to the flux of the nutrient we derive an approximate\ndispersion relation for the growth of the colony interface. This dispersion\nrelation shows that the stability of the growth depends on how far the nutrient\npenetrates into the colony. For low nutrient consumption rates the penetration\ndistance is large, which stabilises the growth, while for high consumption\nrates the penetration distance is small, which leads to unstable branched\ngrowth. When the penetration distance vanishes the dispersion relation is\nreduced to the one describing Laplacian growth without ultra-violet\nregularisation. The dispersion relation was verified by measuring how the\naverage branch width depends on the consumption rate of the cells and shows\ngood agreement between theory and simulations.\n",

Two\nmechanisms of information feedback are investigated: (i) direct mass media\ninfluence, where local or global mass media act as an additional element in the\nnetwork of interactions of each agent, and (ii) indirect mass media influence,\nwhere global media acts as a filter of the influence of the existing network of\ninteractions of each agent.

    "abstract": "  The power spectral density (PSD) function is commonly used to specify\nseismometer performance. It is derived from the FFT of acceleration and\ncorrection is made for the transfer function of the instrument that generated\nthe data. As with any such spectrum of density (`per Hz') type, the noise\ninherent to a PSD is large. This article illustrates the value of a function\nthat is derived from the PSD and for which the influence of noise is\nsignificantly reduced. Called the cumulative spectral power (CSP), it is\nobtained from the PSD through the noise-reducing process of integration. The\nmaximum of the CSP (corresponding to the longest graphed value of the period)\nprovides a means for estimating the total vibrational power of the earth. The\npresent author has significantly simplified the process of PSD generation. Thus\nroutine graphing is straightforwared-of first the FFT, followed by the\ngeneration of both a PSD and its associated CSP. The unique properties of the\nCSP make it valuable for the study of a variety of earth dynamics. For example,\nthe strking simplicity of a CSP graph generated from a record containing a\nstrong teleseismic earthquake is undoubtedly important to the development and\nrefinement of any viable theory of earthquake dynamics.\n",

    "abstract": "  The monotonicity and stability of difference schemes for, in general,\nhyperbolic systems of conservation laws with source terms are studied. The\nbasic approach is to investigate the stability and monotonicity of a non-linear\nscheme in terms of its corresponding scheme in variations. Such an approach\nleads to application of the stability theory for linear equation systems to\nestablish stability of the corresponding non-linear scheme. The main\nmethodological innovation is the theorems establishing the notion that a\nnon-linear scheme is stable (and monotone) if the corresponding scheme in\nvariations is stable (and, respectively, monotone). Criteria are developed for\nmonotonicity and stability of difference schemes associated with the numerical\nanalysis of systems of partial differential equations. The theorem of\nFriedrichs (1954) is generalized to be applicable to variational schemes with\nnon-symmetric matrices. A new modification of the central Lax-Friedrichs (LxF)\nscheme is developed to be of the second order accuracy. A monotone piecewise\ncubic interpolation is used in the central schemes to give an accurate\napproximation for the model in question. The stability and monotonicity of the\nmodified scheme are investigated. Some versions of the modified scheme are\ntested on several conservation laws, and the scheme is found to be accurate and\nrobust. As applied to hyperbolic conservation laws with, in general, stiff\nsource terms, it is constructed a second order scheme based on\noperator-splitting techniques.\n",

This\nis done by considering the classical Galileo-Newtonian space and time relation,\nby using generalized Newtonian principles and adding the approved physical new\nones (as covariance principle, Mach principle, the Einstein equivalence\nprinciple ...) in order to establish a new cosmological model of the dynamical\nUniverse as being $(U(t))_{t\\geq 0}=(B_e(O,t),g_t)_{t\\geq 0}$, where $B_e(O,t)$\nis the Euclidean ball of radius $t$ in $\\mathbb R^3$. The cosmological metric\n$g_t$ is totally determined, at time $t$, by the mass energy distribution\n$E_t(X)$ on $B_e(O,t)$. We study also the black holes phenomenon and we prove\nthat the total and global cosmological energy distribution $E_t(X)$ satisfies\nto the wave equation whose solutions are characterized by pseudo-frequencies\ndepending on time and related to the spectrum of the Dirichlet problem on the\nunit ball $B_e(O,1)$ for the Laplace-Beltrami operator -$\\Delta$.

Laser is an open\nsystem; its equilibrium is based on a balance of two thermodynamic forces, one\nrelated to the incoming pumping power and another to the emitted light. The\nbasic expression for such equilibrium is a logistic map, graphical solutions to\nwhich are pitchfork bifurcation diagrams. As pumping force increases, the\nrelative populations on the ground and lasing branches tend to zero and unity\ncorrespondingly. An interesting feature of this model is the line spectrum of\nthe up and down transitions between the branches beyond bifurcation point. Even\nin a simple case of 2-level laser with only 2 possible transition types (up and\ndown), the spectra look like sets of the line packets, starting well before the\npopulation inversion. This effect is an independent confirmation of the\nEinstein's prohibition on practical realization of 2-level laser. Multilevel\nlasers may be approached by employing the idea of thermodynamic activity for\nthe emitting atoms. Considering coefficient of thermodynamic activity of the\nlasing level atoms to be proportional to the ratio of life times on the upper\nand lasing (the 3d) levels, one can derive a new basic map for the multilevel\nlaser system. For a modest ratio only of 0.01, spontaneous transitions between\nlevels are pushed to the area beyond population inversion, opening a space for\nthe functioning of laser.\n",

In this paper, using the recent results on the asymptotic (in the\nnumber of antennas) outage capacity distribution, we derive and analyze the\nfinite-SNR DMT for a broad class of channels (not necessarily Rayleigh fading).\nBased on this, we give the convergence conditions for the asymptotic DMT to be\napproached by the finite-SNR one. The multiplexing gain definition is shown to\naffect critically the convergence point: when the multiplexing gain is defined\nvia the mean (ergodic) capacity, the convergence takes place at realistic SNR\nvalues. Furthermore, in this case the diversity gain can also be used to\nestimate the outage probability with reasonable accuracy. The multiplexing gain\ndefinition via the high-SNR asymptote of the mean capacity (as in [1]) results\nin very slow convergence for moderate to large systems (as 1/ln(SNR)^2) and,\nhence, the asymptotic DMT cannot be used at realistic SNR values. For this\ndefinition, the high-SNR threshold increases exponentially in the number of\nantennas and in the multiplexing gain. For correlated keyhole channel, the\ndiversity gain is shown to decrease with correlation and power imbalance of the\nchannel.

Contrary to the case of BP decoding, under MS decoding the\nthresholds of the best degree distributions for standard irregular LDPC\nensembles are significantly bounded away from the Shannon threshold.

By reducing from the problem of computing the pathwidth\nof a graph, we show that the problem of determining the pathwidth of a\nrepresentable matroid is NP-hard. Consequently, the problem of computing the\ntrellis-width of a linear code is also NP-hard. For a finite field $\\F$, we\nalso consider the class of $\\F$-representable matroids of pathwidth at most\n$w$, and correspondingly, the family of linear codes over $\\F$ with\ntrellis-width at most $w$. These are easily seen to be minor-closed. Since\nthese matroids (and codes) have branchwidth at most $w$, a result of Geelen and\nWhittle shows that such matroids (and the corresponding codes) are\ncharacterized by finitely many excluded minors. We provide the complete list of\nexcluded minors for $w=1$, and give a partial list for $w=2$.\n",

We show that the number of particles is\nconserved for a resonant state, if we use an expanding volume of integration in\norder to take account of the outgoing momentum flux; the number of particles\nwould decay exponentially in a fixed volume of integration. Moreover, we\nintroduce new numerical methods of treating the resonant state with the use of\nthe effective potential. We first give a numerical method of finding a\nresonance pole in the complex energy plane. The method seeks an energy\neigenvalue iteratively. We found that our method leads to a super-convergence,\nthe convergence exponential with respect to the iteration step. The present\nmethod is completely independent of commonly used complex scaling. We also give\na numerical trick for computing the time evolution of the resonant state in a\nlimited spatial area. Since the wave function of the resonant state is\ndiverging away from the scattering potential, it has been previously difficult\nto follow its time evolution numerically in a finite area.\n",

In addition, the advantage of using\ncondition-monitoring data to enhance the predictive capability of these neural\nnetworks was also investigated. A number of neural network variations were\ntrained and tested with the data of two different reliability-related datasets.\nThe first dataset represents the renewal case where the failed unit is repaired\nand restored to a good-as-new condition. Data was collected in the laboratory\nby subjecting a series of similar test pieces to fatigue loading with a\nhydraulic actuator. The average prediction error of the various neural networks\nbeing compared varied from 431 to 841 seconds on this dataset, where test\npieces had a characteristic life of 8,971 seconds. The second dataset was\ncollected from a group of pumps used to circulate a water and magnetite\nsolution within a plant. The data therefore originated from a repaired system\naffected by reliability degradation. When optimized, the multi-layer perceptron\nneural networks trained with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm and the general\nregression neural network produced a sum-of-squares error within 11.1% of each\nother. The potential for using neural networks for residual life prediction and\nthe advantage of incorporating condition-based data into the model were proven\nfor both examples.\n",

    "abstract": "  In order to explore the magnetostrophic regime expected for planetary cores,\nexperiments have been conducted in a rotating sphere filled with liquid sodium,\nwith an imposed dipolar magnetic field (the DTS setup). The field is produced\nby a permanent magnet enclosed in an inner sphere, which can rotate at a\nseparate rate, producing a spherical Couette flow. The flow properties are\ninvestigated by measuring electric potentials on the outer sphere, the induced\nmagnetic field in the laboratory frame, and velocity profiles inside the liquid\nsodium using ultrasonic Doppler velocimetry. The present article focuses on the\ntime-averaged axisymmetric part of the flow. The Doppler profiles show that the\nangular velocity of the fluid is relatively uniform in most of the fluid shell,\nbut rises near the inner sphere, revealing the presence of a magnetic wind, and\ngently drops towards the outer sphere. The transition from a magnetostrophic\nflow near the inner sphere to a geostrophic flow near the outer sphere is\ncontrolled by the local Elsasser number. For Rossby numbers up to order 1, the\nobserved velocity profiles all show a similar shape. Numerical simulations in\nthe linear regime are computed, and synthetic velocity profiles are compared\nwith the measured ones. In the geostrophic region, a torque-balance model\nprovides very good predictions. We find that the induced magnetic field varies\nin a consistent fashion, and displays a peculiar peak in the counter-rotating\nregime. This happens when the fluid rotation rate is almost equal and opposite\nto the outer sphere rotation rate. The fluid is then almost at rest in the\nlaboratory frame, and the Proudman-Taylor constraint vanishes, enabling a\nstrong meridional flow. We suggest that dynamo action might be favored in such\na situation.\n",

In two example problems, we show that when system stability is\nanalyzed numerically using {\\em descriptor} notation, spurious eigenvalues are\neliminated. Descriptor notation is a generalized eigenvalue formulation for\ndifferential-algebraic equations that explicitly retains algebraic constraints.\nWe propose that spurious eigenvalues are likely to occur when algebraic\nconstraints are used to analytically reduce the number of independent variables\nin a differential-algebraic system of equations before the system is\napproximated numerically.

These degree distributions are a\nsubset of the check regular distributions (i.e. all the check nodes have the\nsame degree), and are referred to as $p$-positive distributions. It is given\nproof that the threshold for a $p$-positive distribution is simply expressed by\n$[\\lambda'(0)\\rho'(1)]^{-1}$. Besides this closed form threshold expression,\nthe $p$-positive distributions exhibit three additional properties. First, for\ngiven code rate, check degree and maximum variable degree, they are in some\ncases characterized by a threshold which is extremely close to that of the best\nknown check regular distributions, under the same set of constraints. Second,\nthe threshold optimization problem within the $p$-positive class can be solved\nin some cases with analytic methods, without using any numerical optimization\ntool.

While the orbital products of\na complete basis are linearly dependent, the HF ground state energy can only be\nobtained via a basis set xOEP scheme in the special case that all products of\noccupied and unoccupied orbitals emerging from the employed orbital basis set\nare linearly independent from each other. In this case, however, exchange\npotentials leading to the HF ground state energy exhibit unphysical\noscillations and do not represent a Kohn-Sham (KS) exchange potential. These\nfindings solve the seemingly paradoxical results of Staroverov, Scuseria and\nDavidson that certain finite basis set xOEP calculations lead to the HF ground\nstate energy despite the fact that within a real space (or complete basis)\nrepresentation the xOEP ground state energy is always higher than the HF\nenergy. Moreover, whether or not the occupied and unoccupied orbital products\nare linearly independent, it is shown that basis set xOEP methods only\nrepresent exact exchange-only (EXX) KS methods, i.e., proper density-functional\nmethods, if the orbital basis set and the auxiliary basis set representing the\nexchange potential are balanced to each other, i.e., if the orbital basis is\ncomprehensive enough for a given auxiliary basis.

It is however well known that the dynamics of the\nmagnetic field is linked to that of the velocity field in the core and any\nattempt to model secular variations will involve a coupled dynamical system for\nmagnetic field and core velocity. Unfortunately, there is no direct observation\nof the velocity. Independently of the exact nature of the above-mentioned\ncoupled system -- some version being currently under construction -- the\nquestion is debated in this paper whether good knowledge of the magnetic field\ncan be translated into good knowledge of core dynamics. Furthermore, what will\nbe the impact of the most recent and precise geomagnetic data on our knowledge\nof the geomagnetic field of the past and future? These questions are cast into\nthe language of variational data assimilation, while the dynamical system\nconsidered in this paper consists in a set of two oversimplified\none-dimensional equations for magnetic and velocity fields. This toy model\nretains important features inherited from the induction and Navier-Stokes\nequations: non-linear magnetic and momentum terms are present and its linear\nresponse to small disturbances contains Alfv\\'en waves. It is concluded that\nvariational data assimilation is indeed appropriate in principle, even though\nthe velocity field remains hidden at all times; it allows us to recover the\nentire evolution of both fields from partial and irregularly distributed\ninformation on the magnetic field. This work constitutes a first step on the\nway toward the reassimilation of historical geomagnetic data and geomagnetic\nforecast.\n",

    "abstract": "  A game-theoretic framework is used to study the effect of constellation size\non the energy efficiency of wireless networks for M-QAM modulation. A\nnon-cooperative game is proposed in which each user seeks to choose its\ntransmit power (and possibly transmit symbol rate) as well as the constellation\nsize in order to maximize its own utility while satisfying its delay\nquality-of-service (QoS) constraint. The utility function used here measures\nthe number of reliable bits transmitted per joule of energy consumed, and is\nparticularly suitable for energy-constrained networks. The best-response\nstrategies and Nash equilibrium solution for the proposed game are derived. It\nis shown that in order to maximize its utility (in bits per joule), a user must\nchoose the lowest constellation size that can accommodate the user's delay\nconstraint. This strategy is different from one that would maximize spectral\nefficiency. Using this framework, the tradeoffs among energy efficiency, delay,\nthroughput and constellation size are also studied and quantified. In addition,\nthe effect of trellis-coded modulation on energy efficiency is discussed.\n",

For this extensive family of demand distributions we derive a\nclosed-form expression for the per object steady-state hit ratio. To the best\nof our knowledge, this is the first analytic derivation of the per object hit\nratio of LRU that can be obtained in constant time without requiring laborious\nnumeric computations or simulation. Since most applications of replacement\nalgorithms include (at least) some scenarios under i.i.d. requests, our method\nhas substantial practical value, especially when having to analyze multiple\ncaches, where existing numeric methods and simulation become too time\nconsuming.\n",

In BICMB, this property does not hold. On the\nother hand, the optimum precoder and detector for BICMB are invariant under a\ndiagonal unitary transform. In order to design a limited-rate CSIT system for\nBICMB, we propose a new distortion measure optimum under this invariance. Based\non this new distortion measure, we introduce a new set of centroids and employ\nthe generalized Lloyd algorithm for codebook design. We provide simulation\nresults demonstrating the performance improvement achieved with the proposed\ndistortion measure and the codebook design for various receivers with linear\ndetectors.

These\nlimitations are independent of the topology and message transmission latency.\nIn this paper we consider a peer-to-peer network, based on the Engset model,\nwhere peers arrive and depart independently at random. We show how the arrival\nand departure rates directly limit the capacity for message streams to be\nbroadcast to all other peers, by deriving mean field models that accurately\ndescribe the system behavior. Our models cover the unit and more general k\nbuffer cases, i.e. where a peer can buffer at most k messages at any one time,\nand we give results for both single and multi-source message streams. We define\ncoverage rate as peer-messages per unit time, i.e. the rate at which a number\nof peers receive messages, and show that the coverage rate is limited by the\nchurn rate and buffer size. Our theory introduces an Instantaneous Message\nExchange (IME) model and provides a template for further analysis of more\ncomplicated systems. Using the IME model, and assuming random processes, we\nhave obtained very accurate equations of the system dynamics in a variety of\ninteresting cases, that allow us to tune a peer-to-peer system.

The immediate consequence is that energy is not\nconserved: the hypothesis that time is a homogeneous property implies\nconservation of energy (the theorem of Noether). Nonconservation of energy\nfollows from the condition that any time interval is proportional to the\ncosmological time, and therefore time can not be homogeneous. From the\nuncertainty principle, taking the constant of Planck as a real constant, time\nindependent, it follows that any energy in the Universe decreases linearly with\ntime. We then prove that Schroedinger equation does not change, except for the\npotential energy term. The future of the Universe gives for the wave functions\na long sinusoidal spatial solution, so that everything becomes unlocalized.

We\npropose to control the users jointly, specifically, we first choose the users\njointly and then select the corresponding beamforming vectors jointly. To\nquantify the sum rate, this paper introduces the composite Grassmann manifold\nand the composite Grassmann matrix. By characterizing the distortion rate\nfunction on the composite Grassmann manifold and calculating the logdet\nfunction of a random composite Grassmann matrix, a good sum rate approximation\nis derived. According to the distortion rate function on the composite\nGrassmann manifold, the loss due to finite beamforming decreases exponentially\nas the feedback bits on beamforming increases.\n",

The unique contribution is the derivation of a closed-form\nformula for the volume of a metric ball in the Grassmann manifold when the\nradius is sufficiently small. This volume formula holds for Grassmann manifolds\nwith arbitrary dimension n and p, while previous results are only valid for\neither p=1 or a fixed p with asymptotically large n. Based on the volume\nformula, the Gilbert-Varshamov and Hamming bounds for sphere packings are\nobtained. Assuming a uniformly distributed source and a distortion metric based\non the squared chordal distance, tight lower and upper bounds are established\nfor the distortion rate tradeoff. Simulation results match the derived results.\nAs an application of the derived quantization bounds, the information rate of a\nMultiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) system with finite-rate channel-state\nfeedback is accurately quantified for arbitrary finite number of antennas,\nwhile previous results are only valid for either Multiple-Input Single-Output\n(MISO) systems or those with asymptotically large number of transmit antennas\nbut fixed number of receive antennas.\n",

    "abstract": "  This paper quantifies the information rate of multiple-input multiple-output\n(MIMO) systems with finite rate channel state feedback and power on/off\nstrategy. In power on/off strategy, a beamforming vector (beam) is either\nturned on (denoted by on-beam) with a constant power or turned off. We prove\nthat the ratio of the optimal number of on-beams and the number of antennas\nconverges to a constant for a given signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) when the number\nof transmit and receive antennas approaches infinity simultaneously and when\nbeamforming is perfect. Based on this result, a near optimal strategy, i.e.,\npower on/off strategy with a constant number of on-beams, is discussed. For\nsuch a strategy, we propose the power efficiency factor to quantify the effect\nof imperfect beamforming. A formula is proposed to compute the maximum power\nefficiency factor achievable given a feedback rate. The information rate of the\noverall MIMO system can be approximated by combining the asymptotic results and\nthe formula for power efficiency factor.

    "abstract": "  This paper considers broadcast channels with L antennas at the base station\nand m single-antenna users, where each user has perfect channel knowledge and\nthe base station obtains channel information through a finite rate feedback.\nThe key observation of this paper is that the optimal number of on-users (users\nturned on), say s, is a function of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and other\nsystem parameters. Towards this observation, we use asymptotic analysis to\nguide the design of feedback and transmission strategies. As L, m and the\nfeedback rates approach infinity linearly, we derive the asymptotic optimal\nfeedback strategy and a realistic criterion to decide which users should be\nturned on. Define the corresponding asymptotic throughput per antenna as the\nspatial efficiency. It is a function of the number of on-users s, and\ntherefore, s should be appropriately chosen. Based on the above asymptotic\nresults, we also develop a scheme for a system with finite many antennas and\nusers. Compared with other works where s is presumed constant, our scheme\nachieves a significant gain by choosing the appropriate s. Furthermore, our\nanalysis and scheme is valid for heterogeneous systems where different users\nmay have different path loss coefficients and feedback rates.\n",

    "abstract": "  The Grassmann manifold G_{n,p}(L) is the set of all p-dimensional planes\n(through the origin) in the n-dimensional Euclidean space L^{n}, where L is\neither R or C. This paper considers an unequal dimensional quantization in\nwhich a source in G_{n,p}(L) is quantized through a code in G_{n,q}(L), where p\nand q are not necessarily the same. It is different from most works in\nliterature where p\\equiv q. The analysis for unequal dimensional quantization\nis based on the volume of a metric ball in G_{n,p}(L) whose center is in\nG_{n,q}(L). Our chief result is a closed-form formula for the volume of a\nmetric ball when the radius is sufficiently small. This volume formula holds\nfor Grassmann manifolds with arbitrary n, p, q and L, while previous results\npertained only to some special cases. Based on this volume formula, several\nbounds are derived for the rate distortion tradeoff assuming the quantization\nrate is sufficiently high. The lower and upper bounds on the distortion rate\nfunction are asymptotically identical, and so precisely quantify the asymptotic\nrate distortion tradeoff. We also show that random codes are asymptotically\noptimal in the sense that they achieve the minimum achievable distortion with\nprobability one as n and the code rate approach infinity linearly. Finally, we\ndiscuss some applications of the derived results to communication theory. A\ngeometric interpretation in the Grassmann manifold is developed for capacity\ncalculation of additive white Gaussian noise channel.

In the proposed model, the\ndesired independent components are piecewise homogeneous images which share the\nsame common hidden segmentation variable. Thus, the joint Bayesian estimation\nof this hidden variable as well as the sources and the mixing matrix of the\nsource separation problem gives a solution for all the three problems of\ndimensionality reduction, spectra classification and segmentation of\nhyperspectral images.

The\naverage thickness of the MT also follows an annual cycle, going from less than\n1 km in spring to 1.5 km in late autumn.

The\nenergy budget of the plasma involves the input from heating through\nphoto-electron emission by dust particles under external ultraviolet radiation\nas well as radiative losses in inelastic electron-neutral, electron-ion,\nneutral-neutral collisions. It is shown that negatively charged particles\nstimulate the RC instability in the sense that the conditions for the\ninstability to hold are wider than similar conditions in a single-fluid\ndescription.\n",

    "title": "Clustering by soft-constraint affinity propagation: Applications to\n  gene-expression data",
    "abstract": "  Motivation: Similarity-measure based clustering is a crucial problem\nappearing throughout scientific data analysis. Recently, a powerful new\nalgorithm called Affinity Propagation (AP) based on message-passing techniques\nwas proposed by Frey and Dueck \\cite{Frey07}. In AP, each cluster is identified\nby a common exemplar all other data points of the same cluster refer to, and\nexemplars have to refer to themselves. Albeit its proved power, AP in its\npresent form suffers from a number of drawbacks. The hard constraint of having\nexactly one exemplar per cluster restricts AP to classes of regularly shaped\nclusters, and leads to suboptimal performance, {\\it e.g.}, in analyzing gene\nexpression data. Results: This limitation can be overcome by relaxing the AP\nhard constraints. A new parameter controls the importance of the constraints\ncompared to the aim of maximizing the overall similarity, and allows to\ninterpolate between the simple case where each data point selects its closest\nneighbor as an exemplar and the original AP. The resulting soft-constraint\naffinity propagation (SCAP) becomes more informative, accurate and leads to\nmore stable clustering. Even though a new {\\it a priori} free-parameter is\nintroduced, the overall dependence of the algorithm on external tuning is\nreduced, as robustness is increased and an optimal strategy for parameter\nselection emerges more naturally. SCAP is tested on biological benchmark data,\nincluding in particular microarray data related to various cancer types. We\nshow that the algorithm efficiently unveils the hierarchical cluster structure\npresent in the data sets. Further on, it allows to extract sparse gene\nexpression signatures for each cluster.\n",

Consistency requires that the corresponding box\nmeasurements be complementary as well. At first sight it seems, however, that\nthese measurements can be jointly performed with arbitrary precision: they\npertain to different systems (the center of mass of the box and an internal\nclock, respectively). But this is deceptive. As we show by explicit\ncalculation, although the relevant quantities are simultaneously measurable,\nthey develop non-vanishing commutators when calculated back to the time of\nescape of the photon. This justifies Bohr's qualitative arguments in a precise\nway; and it illustrates how the details of the dynamics conspire to guarantee\nthe requirements of complementarity. In addition, our calculations exhibit a\n``fine structure'' in the distribution of the uncertainties over the\ncomplementary quantities: depending on \\textit{when} the box measurement is\nperformed, the resulting quantum description of the photon differs.

The loop oscillates in the upright\nposition at a frequency that can be tuned in the range 10-1000 Hz, and has\ninduced in it a rectified electrical current. The emphasis of this paper is on\nthe evaluation of the major remaining source of losses in the oscillations. We\nargue that such losses should be associated with the viscous vibration of\npinned flux lines in the superconductor Nb-Ti wire, provided the oscillator is\nkept close to zero Kelvin, under high-vacuum, and the magnetic field is\nsufficiently uniform. We discuss how other different sources of loss would\nbecome negligible for such operational conditions, so that a very high quality\nfactor Q exceeding 10^(10) might in principle be reached by the oscillator. The\nprospective utilization of such oscillator as a low-frequency high-Q clock is\nanalyzed.Since publication the ideas in this paper have been explored both by\nthe author and elsewhere, in applications covering Metrology, quantum systems,\nand gravimetry.\n",

    "title": "Capacity of Sparse Multipath Channels in the Ultra-Wideband Regime",
    "abstract": "  This paper studies the ergodic capacity of time- and frequency-selective\nmultipath fading channels in the ultrawideband (UWB) regime when training\nsignals are used for channel estimation at the receiver. Motivated by recent\nmeasurement results on UWB channels, we propose a model for sparse multipath\nchannels. A key implication of sparsity is that the independent degrees of\nfreedom (DoF) in the channel scale sub-linearly with the signal space dimension\n(product of signaling duration and bandwidth). Sparsity is captured by the\nnumber of resolvable paths in delay and Doppler. Our analysis is based on a\ntraining and communication scheme that employs signaling over orthogonal\nshort-time Fourier (STF) basis functions. STF signaling naturally relates\nsparsity in delay-Doppler to coherence in time-frequency. We study the impact\nof multipath sparsity on two fundamental metrics of spectral efficiency in the\nwideband/low-SNR limit introduced by Verdu: first- and second-order optimality\nconditions. Recent results by Zheng et. al. have underscored the large gap in\nspectral efficiency between coherent and non-coherent extremes and the\nimportance of channel learning in bridging the gap. Building on these results,\nour results lead to the following implications of multipath sparsity: 1) The\ncoherence requirements are shared in both time and frequency, thereby\nsignificantly relaxing the required scaling in coherence time with SNR; 2)\nSparse multipath channels are asymptotically coherent -- for a given but large\nbandwidth, the channel can be learned perfectly and the coherence requirements\nfor first- and second-order optimality met through sufficiently large signaling\nduration; and 3) The requirement of peaky signals in attaining capacity is\neliminated or relaxed in sparse environments.\n",

We propose a model for sparse\nmultipath fading channels and present results on the impact of sparsity on\nnon-coherent capacity and reliability in the wideband regime. A key implication\nof sparsity is that the statistically independent degrees of freedom in the\nchannel, that represent the delay-Doppler diversity afforded by multipath,\nscale at a sub-linear rate with the signal space dimension (time-bandwidth\nproduct). Our analysis is based on a training-based communication scheme that\nuses short-time Fourier (STF) signaling waveforms. Sparsity in delay-Doppler\nmanifests itself as time-frequency coherence in the STF domain. From a capacity\nperspective, sparse channels are asymptotically coherent: the gap between\ncoherent and non-coherent extremes vanishes in the limit of large signal space\ndimension without the need for peaky signaling. From a reliability viewpoint,\nthere is a fundamental tradeoff between channel diversity and learnability that\ncan be optimized to maximize the error exponent at any rate by appropriately\nchoosing the signaling duration as a function of bandwidth.\n",

In particular,\nwe first consider the problem of sequentially scanning and filtering noisy\nrandom fields. In this case, the sequential filter is given the freedom to\nchoose the path over which it traverses the random field (e.g., noisy image or\nvideo sequence), thus it is natural to ask what is the best achievable\nperformance and how sensitive this performance is to the choice of the scan. We\nformally define the problem of scanning and filtering, derive a bound on the\nbest achievable performance and quantify the excess loss occurring when\nnon-optimal scanners are used, compared to optimal scanning and filtering.\n  We then discuss the problem of sequential scanning and prediction of noisy\nrandom fields.

We formally define the problem of\nscanning and prediction of a noisy multidimensional array and relate the\noptimal performance to the clean scandictability defined by Merhav and\nWeissman. Moreover, bounds on the excess loss due to sub-optimal scans are\nderived, and a universal prediction algorithm is suggested.\n  This paper is the second part of a two-part paper.

The generic coincidence problem that appears in the\noriginal Einstein universe model is shown to arise from a misunderstanding\nabout the magnitude of dark energy density and the epoch time governing the\nappearance of the integer relation between dark energy and normal energy\ndensity. The solution to the generic case then clearly points to the source of\nthe time coincidence integer problem in the Friedman dust universe model.

We demonstrate that the cascade term\nnaturally leads to a nearly Lorentzian shape of the two-photon profiles in the\nvicinity of the resonances. However, due to quantum-electrodynamical\ncorrections, the two-photon emission spectra deviate significantly from the\nLorentzian shape in the very distant wings of the resonances. We investigate up\nto which distance the two-photon profiles are close to a Lorentzian and discuss\nthe role of the interference term.

First, we define relevant notions of size for both a\nhomology class and a homology group basis, using ideas from relative homology.\nSecond, we propose an algorithm to compute the optimal homology basis, using\ntechniques from persistent homology and finite field algebra. Classes of the\ncomputed optimal basis are localized with cycles conveying their sizes. The\nalgorithm runs in $O(\\beta^4 n^3 \\log^2 n)$ time, where $n$ is the size of the\nsimplicial complex and $\\beta$ is the Betti number of the homology group.\n",

    "title": "Pixels simultaneous detection probabilities and spatial resolution\n  determination of pixelized detectors by means of correlation measurements",
    "abstract": "  A novel method to estimate the pixels simultaneous detection probability and\nthe spatial resolution of pixelized detectors is proposed, which is based on\nthe determination of the statistical correlations between detector neighbor\npixels. The correlations are determined by means of noise variance measurement\nfor a isolated pixels and the difference between neighbor pixels. The method is\nvalidated using images from the two different GE Senographe 2000D mammographic\nunits. The pixelized detector has been irradiated using x-rays along its entire\nsurface. It is shown that the pixel simultaneous detection probabilities can be\nestimated within accuracy 0.001 - 0.003, where the systematic error is\nestimated to be smaller than 0.005. The presampled two-dimensional point-spread\nfunction (PSF0) is determined using a single Gaussian and a sum of two Gaussian\napproximations. The obtained results for the presampled PSF0 show that the\nsingle Gaussian approximation is not appropriate, and the sum of two Gaussian\napproximations providing the best fit predicts the existence of a large (~50%)\nnarrow component. Another proof of this fact is the latest simulation study of\ncolumnar indirect digital detectors by A. Badano et al. The sampled\ntwo-dimensional PSF is determined using Monte Carlo simulation for the L-shape\nuniform distributed acceptance function for different values of fill factors.\nThe detector spatial resolution is estimated using sampled PSF and has values\n54 and 58 mkm for two different units. The calculation of the presampled\nmodulation transfer function based on the PSF0 estimation shows that the\nexisting data can only be reproduced using a single Gaussian approximation and\nthe usage of the sum of two Gaussian show significantly larger values in the\nhigher frequency region for both units.\n",

    "title": "Extending the redshift-distance relation in Cosmological General\n  Relativity to higher redshifts",
    "abstract": "  The redshift-distance modulus relation, the Hubble Diagram, derived from\nCosmological General Relativity has been extended to arbitrarily large\nredshifts. Numerical methods were employed and a density function was found\nthat results in a valid solution of the field equations at all redshifts. The\nextension has been compared to 302 type Ia supernova data as well as to 69\nGamma-ray burst data. The latter however do not not truly represent a `standard\ncandle' as the derived distance modulii are not independent of the cosmology\nused. Nevertheless the analysis shows a good fit can be achieved without the\nneed to assume the existence of dark matter.\n  The Carmelian theory is also shown to describe a universe that is always\nspatially flat. This results from the underlying assumption of the energy\ndensity of a cosmological constant $\\Omega_{\\Lambda} = 1$, the result of vacuum\nenergy. The curvature of the universe is described by a \\textit{spacevelocity}\nmetric where the energy content of the curvature at any epoch is $\\Omega_K =\n\\Omega_{\\Lambda} - \\Omega = 1-\\Omega$, where $\\Omega$ is the matter density of\nthe universe. Hence the total density is always $\\Omega_K + \\Omega = 1$\n",

    "title": "Distortion Minimization in Gaussian Layered Broadcast Coding with\n  Successive Refinement",
    "abstract": "  A transmitter without channel state information (CSI) wishes to send a\ndelay-limited Gaussian source over a slowly fading channel. The source is coded\nin superimposed layers, with each layer successively refining the description\nin the previous one. The receiver decodes the layers that are supported by the\nchannel realization and reconstructs the source up to a distortion. The\nexpected distortion is minimized by optimally allocating the transmit power\namong the source layers. For two source layers, the allocation is optimal when\npower is first assigned to the higher layer up to a power ceiling that depends\nonly on the channel fading distribution; all remaining power, if any, is\nallocated to the lower layer. For convex distortion cost functions with convex\nconstraints, the minimization is formulated as a convex optimization problem.\nIn the limit of a continuum of infinite layers, the minimum expected distortion\nis given by the solution to a set of linear differential equations in terms of\nthe density of the fading distribution. As the bandwidth ratio b (channel uses\nper source symbol) tends to zero, the power distribution that minimizes\nexpected distortion converges to the one that maximizes expected capacity.\nWhile expected distortion can be improved by acquiring CSI at the transmitter\n(CSIT) or by increasing diversity from the realization of independent fading\npaths, at high SNR the performance benefit from diversity exceeds that from\nCSIT, especially when b is large.\n",

    "abstract": "  In Lagrangian turbulence one is faced with the puzzle that 2D\n  Navier-Stokes flows are nearly as intermittent as in three dimensions\nalthough no intermittency is present in the inverse cascade in 2D Eulerian\nturbulence. In addition, an inertial range is very difficult to detect and it\nis questionable whether it exists at all. Here, we investigate the transition\nof Eulerian to Lagrangian probability density functions (PDFs) which leads to a\nnew type of Lagrangian structure function. This possesses an extended inertial\nrange similar to the case of tracer particles in a frozen turbulent velocity\nfield. This allows a connection to the scaling of Eulerian transversal\nstructure functions.\n",

The interpolation scheme for\nobtaining velocity values at particle positions has a noticeable impact on the\nLagrangian acceleration statistics. A tri-cubic scheme results in a slightly\nbroader acceleration probability density function than a tri-linear scheme.\nFurthermore the scaling behavior obtained by the cubic interpolation scheme\nexhibits a tendency towards a slightly increased degree of intermittency\ncompared to the linear one.\n",
