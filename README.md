# 🚀 NullClass Internship Project🚀

This repository contains the complete work done for the NullClass internship project, focused on building intelligent and domain-specific chatbots using cutting-edge NLP techniques, open-source LLMs, and vector databases.

Each part of the project is organized in dedicated folders:
- [`Question1`](./Question1): Article Generator using 3 Open-Source LLMs
- [`Question2`](./Question2): Dynamic Knowledge Base Update System
- [`Question3`](./Question3): ArXiv Research Assistant Chatbot

## 📁 Project Structure

### 🔹 Question1 - Article Generator Chatbot

> **Objective**: Compare three open-source LLMs and evaluate which one generates the best articles.

**Features**:
- Integrated three LLMs for article generation.
- Text preprocessing using NLP techniques.
- Evaluation based on coherence, fluency, and factual accuracy.

**Outcome**:
- Article Generation.
- Identification of the best LLM for article creation.

### 🔹 Question2 - Dynamic Vector Database Updater

> **Objective**: Implement a system that automatically updates the chatbot's knowledge base with fresh content over time.

**Features**:
- Periodic crawling and fetching from data sources.
- `update_memory()` mechanism in place.
- Memory-efficient and real-time knowledge ingestion.

**Outcome**:
- Chatbot that learns new content dynamically without retraining.

📂 Folder: [`Question2`](./Question2)

### 🔹 Question3 - ArXiv Research Assistant Chatbot

> **Objective**: Build a domain-specific expert chatbot using the [arXiv dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/Cornell-University/arxiv) (Computer Science subset).

**Features**:
- Preprocessing of large-scale scientific papers dataset.
- Extraction of abstracts, titles, and category metadata.
- RAG-based chatbot using FAISS + Open-source LLMs.
- Summarization + Explanation of complex research concepts.
- Streamlit GUI with search and Q&A features.

**Outcome**:
- Chatbot that can:
  - Search & summarize research papers.
  - Explain advanced CS concepts.
  - Handle follow-up questions.

📂 Folder: [`Question3`](./Question3)
